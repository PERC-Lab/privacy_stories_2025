For example, one of the ways we use this information is to count the number of times an advert or other content is viewed because this might be the metric by which our advertisers pay us. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Allow you to participate in interactive features such as Gameplay events on the Platform, providing you with relevant gameplay experience, determine and declaring winners, and providing you with prizes.
