This Statement of Privacy applies to the Ncontracts website and governs data collection and usage. By using the Ncontracts, or associated company, website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.
Collection of your Personal Information
Ncontracts, and any associated company, collect personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, or telephone number. Ncontracts, and any associated company, also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests, and favorites.
There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Ncontracts, or any associated company. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses. This information is used by Ncontracts, or any associated company, for the operation of the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding the use of the Ncontracts
website .
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Ncontracts' public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Ncontracts does not read any of your private online communications.
Ncontracts encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Ncontracts so that you can understand how those websites collect, use, and share your information. Ncontracts is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Ncontracts and Ncontracts family of websites.
Use of your Personal Information
Ncontracts collects and uses your personal information to operate the Ncontracts website and deliver the services you have requested. Ncontracts also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Ncontracts and its affiliates. Ncontracts may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
Ncontracts does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Ncontracts may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Ncontracts may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Ncontracts, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
Ncontracts does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
Ncontracts keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit within Ncontracts, in order to determine what Ncontracts services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Ncontracts to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
Ncontracts websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Ncontracts or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Ncontracts; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Ncontracts, or the public.
Use of Cookies
The Ncontracts website uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Ncontracts pages, or register with Ncontracts site or services, a cookie helps Ncontracts to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Ncontracts website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Ncontracts features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Ncontracts services or websites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Ncontracts secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Ncontracts secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Changes to this Statement
Ncontracts will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Ncontracts encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Ncontracts is protecting your information.
