Location Data If you share a location in a chat, this location data is treated like other messages in cloud or secret chats respectively. If you share your Live Location in any chat or turn on ’Make Myself Visible’ in People Nearby, Eitagram will use your data to display your location to those users with whom you are sharing it, even when the app is closed – for as long as you keep these optional features activated. Before accessing your device's location: We will clearly indicate the term “location”. We will notify you that the location may be used in the background, specifying situations such as during "Live Location" sharing. A detailed list of Eitagram features that rely on background location data will be provided for transparency. Your explicit consent will always be sought before accessing location data. The choice to grant or deny this permission is entirely up to you, and should you grant it, you can revoke this permission anytime via your device's settings. Eitagram commits to the responsible use of location data. We neither sell nor share your location data for any purpose outside of the app's functionalities. The processing of this data guarantees its confidentiality and security. Location Data Collection Our app, Eitagram, offers features inherited from the original Telegram platform, such as "Live Location" sharing and "People Nearby", which require access to users' location data to function. To deliver these features seamlessly, we request your device's location access. Location data, whether from "Live Location" sharing or the "People Nearby" feature, is retained only as long as necessary to serve its function and then deleted promptly. While we offer features similar to Telegram, Eitagram prioritizes user privacy. We continuously evaluate our data handling practices to ensure user trust and compliance with privacy standards. Live Location Sharing Eitagram allows users to share their real-time location with chosen contacts. When users opt to use the "Live Location" sharing feature, we continuously track and share their live location for the duration specified by the user or until they choose to end the sharing. People Nearby Feature The "People Nearby" functionality within Eitagram is an innovative feature designed to foster connections and expand your social horizon. This capability can serve as a platform for finding new friends, expanding your network. The "People Nearby" functionality is designed to help users discover other Eitagram users in their vicinity. By accessing and using this feature, your location data is used to calculate and display people who are close to your current location. Background Location Access For the convenience of our users, Eitagram might use location data in the background, especially when the "Live Location" feature is activated, allowing contacts to monitor your real-time location even if the app is not actively open. Phone Number and Contacts Eitagram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts. We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts. Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Eitagram. When you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram. Upon installation of our application, users may be requested to grant access to their Contact List information. We collect this data solely to enhance the functionality and user experience of the app. The information obtained from the Contact List will not be shared, sold, or distributed to any third party without your explicit consent. Also to ensure the utmost protection of your Contact List information, we utilize industry-standard encryption protocols during the transmission and storage of data. You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings. Eitagram API By installing and using the Eitagram application, you agree to the following terms. Eitagram uses its own API to receive settings, such as proxies and AdMob settings. All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted to ensure its security and protection from unauthorized access. Eitagram collects general statistics related to errors and the number of installations to improve the overall user experience. This data is used to identify and rectify any issues promptly. Eitagram utilizes its own API proxy, which automatically provides the fastest Telegram proxies to users. These proxies are designed in a way that they do not access your messages, ensuring the safety and privacy of your data. The security of these proxies is guaranteed by Telegram, and you can safely use MTProto proxies to establish connections. Upon installation of Eitagram, the program is authorized to calculate the ping of each proxy from the user's side. This information is sent to our servers to enhance the quality of the proxy list and provide users with an optimized experience. By continuing to use Eitagram, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accepted the terms stated above. For further information about MTProto proxies, please refer to Telegram's policy. Deleting Data You can delete any data from the app at any time Accounts If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone. How do I delete my account? If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the
deactivation page . Deleting your account permanently removes all your messages and contacts. All groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.
