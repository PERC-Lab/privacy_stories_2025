3. HOW INFORMATION IS USED, SHARED AND DISCLOSED
VISIONMOBI does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent. Except as set forth in Section 10 of this Privacy Policy, parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as VISIONMOBI does not share information that may be collected from your child. VISIONMOBI uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the VISIONMOBI Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of VISIONMOBI’s business. Examples of how VISIONMOBI shares and discloses your information is as follows:
Legal. VISIONMOBI may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise VISIONMOBI’s legal rights. VISIONMOBI may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when VISIONMOBI believes that disclosure is necessary to protect VISIONMOBI’s rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. VISIONMOBI may share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of VISIONMOBI’s Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
Business Transfers. As VISIONMOBI continues to develop its business, VISIONMOBI may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of VISIONMOBI’s assets are acquired or VISIONMOBI merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that VISIONMOBI reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, VISIONMOBI will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

VISIONMOBI shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this Privacy Policy.
