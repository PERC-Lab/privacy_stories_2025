Hampton Roads Greenbook® - Highlighting Hampton Roads' Black & Minority Businesses, Organizations, & Professionals.
A study by the  Selig Center for Economic Growth  found that money circulates one time in the 'Black' community, six times in the Latino community, and nine times in the Asian community. In white neighborhoods, money circulates nearly an unlimited number of times.  We're ensuring that monies circulate stronger and longer!   In the 1930s, a Harlem postal carrier named  Victor Green  and his wife Alma Green published  The Negro Motorist Greenbook . These survival and travel guides showcased businesses welcoming to all patrons in America, Bermuda, Canada, Mexico, and The Caribbean.  The Hampton Roads Green Book ® is a nod to that historical solution and allows entry to all while highlighting Black, Veteran, and Minority Organizations, Professionals, and Businesses in Hampton Roads.
This is an initiative of the  200+ Men 's Economic Advancement Committee and Positive Vibes Inc. To participate, use the  online submission tools . For Partnership opportunities:  HamptonRoadsGreenbook @ gmail.com  or call Mr. Seko Varner at (757) 932-0177.
