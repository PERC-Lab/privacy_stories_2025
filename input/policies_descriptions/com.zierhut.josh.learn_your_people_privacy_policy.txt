1. Introduction
Welcome to Learn Your People, a mobile app developed by Joshua Zierhut ("I", "me", or "the developer").

Any data that you add to the app (such as images, names, or audio files) stays on your local device and is not collected by the developer in any way.
3. Third-Party Services
The app does use a third-party service which may collect personally identifiable information. Here is a link to the privacy policy of the third-party service provider used by the app:

Since I do not collect any personal data, I also do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has somehow provided me with personal information, please contact me at
