We may, at our discretion, revoke or restrict access to the Open Beta program for any user who violates the terms of participation or engages in behavior that disrupts the testing process.
10.6 Opt-Out of Open Beta Testing
Participation in Open Beta testing is entirely voluntary. If you do not wish to participate in Open Beta testing or have concerns about data security and privacy, you may choose to use the stable, publicly available version of the Service instead. You can opt out of Open Beta testing at any time by switching to the standard version of the Service.
Please note that this Open Beta testing clause is in addition to the existing privacy policy and does not alter the rights and obligations outlined in the original privacy policy. By participating in Open Beta testing, you agree to these additional terms and conditions.
