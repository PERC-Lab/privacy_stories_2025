IV. Personal Information Use & Processing
In providing the suite of RealPage Services, RealPage primarily acts as a service provider under contract to our Clients 1 . As a service provider, RealPage does not control any of the personal information we process on behalf of our Clients. Our Clients collect and control all such personal information, and RealPage is required to provide our products and services in accordance with Clients’ contractual provisions and instructions regarding data collection, privacy, processing, and security. Where RealPage is providing services as a data controller, a separate privacy policy is provided exclusively for such services at the point of data collection.
Accordingly, we may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following purposes:
To fulfill the purpose for which the personal information was collected and provide the requested RealPage Services.
To integrate with apartment community services offered by RealPage or third-party service providers contracted by Clients.
To distribute communications and legally required notices regarding the status of RealPage Services via phone, email, and SMS text.
To provide RealPage Services maintenance, enhancement, research, development, security, support, and website optimization.
To maintain compliance with federal and state laws related to software-as-a-service, background screening, financial institutions, and money services businesses.
To create, maintain, customize, and secure RealPage Services user accounts.
To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of RealPage's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by RealPage is among the assets transferred.
RealPage will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice. Additionally, RealPage processing of sensitive personal information is limited to activities necessary for the delivery and performance of RealPage Services on behalf of our Clients and end users.
V. Personal Information Disclosure
RealPage
does not sell personal information
collected through RealPage Services, and no such disclosure has occurred in the prior 12 months.
RealPage may provide personal information to third parties for business purposes under limited circumstances, including service providers and vendors that support or integrate with the RealPage Services described in this statement (see chart below). RealPage only discloses personal information to the extent reasonably necessary to support RealPage Services requirements, or for the third-party vendors or service providers to perform the services on our or our Clients’ behalf. We do not permit third party vendors or service providers to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.

VI. Personal Information Rights and Choices – State Privacy Rights
Certain state jurisdictions (California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah) provide their legal residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. Each right includes the ability to make a specific consumer request and corresponding obligation of the receiving party to (i) verify the identity of the requestor and (ii) respond in accordance with statutory guidelines. This section describes your rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Accessing and Updating Personal Information
In the event your personal information is determined to be outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, you may access and update your information by logging into your RealPage Services account or contacting your property manager. If you require verification that your requested changes have been completed, and such verification is not readily displayed in your RealPage Services account, you may request confirmation at the email address listed below (See “Contact Us”).
Access to Specific Information Regarding Personal Information Use/Disclosure and Portability
You have the right to request a summary of the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information over the past 12 months.
Under most circumstances, this request for disclosure should be submitted to the
property manager
that operates your apartment community or rental property.
As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
However, eRenterPlan, eRenterDirect, Lease Term Solutions, DepositIQ, and ResidentDirect consumer requests should be submitted directly to RealPage. In response to a verifiable consumer request for these services, we will disclose the following information for the applicable RealPage Services:
The categories, specific types, and sources of personal information we collected about you.
Our business purpose for collecting the personal information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information and the purpose for the disclosure.
You also have the right to request a copy of this personal information in a readily useable format that is transferable to other entities (frequently referred to as “data portability”). If you make a data portability request, RealPage may be (i) restricted from providing certain sensitive personal information in response to the request or (ii) prohibited from granting the request entirely if it presents an unreasonable security risk.
Deletion of Personal Information
You have the right to request that RealPage delete any of your personal information that we collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Under most circumstances, this request for deletion should be submitted to the
property manager
that operates your apartment community or rental property.
As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
However, eRenterPlan, eRenterDirect, Lease Term Solutions, DepositIQ, and ResidentDirect consumer requests should be submitted directly to RealPage.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete or de-identify (and direct our service providers to delete or de-identify) your personal information from our records, unless one of the following exceptions applies:
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for RealPage or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide the RealPage Services that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you or your property manager, or otherwise perform our contract with you or your property manager.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug RealPage Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us or our Clients.
Comply with laws, regulations, statutes, codes, ordinances, or other legal obligations.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
VII. Submitting Consumer Requests - Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
Under most circumstances, consumer requests should be submitted to the
property manager
that operates your apartment community or rental property.
As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
However, eRenterPlan, eRenterDirect, Lease Term Solutions, DepositIQ, and ResidentDirect consumer requests should be submitted directly to RealPage. To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Calling us toll-free at:
For eRenterPlan and eRenterDirect: (888)512-4204
For Lease Term Solutions (AssetProtect and LeaseProtect): (888)814-6950 – Select Option 1
For DepositIQ: (877)684-4039 – Select Option 3
For ResidentDirect: (844)530-5785
OR
Via the secure webform linked
here
Only you (or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf) may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to confirm your identity as the person about whom we collected personal information (and, if applicable, the authority and identity of an authorized representative).
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Please note, we cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot (i) verify your identity or authority to make the request and (ii) confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
VIII. Consumer Request Responses and Timelines
We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please
privacy@realpage.com . We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require additional time beyond the 45 days, we are entitled to an extension up to an additional 45 days (for a total response timeline capped at 90 days). In the event that an extension is necessary, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account where possible. If you do not have an account with us, or your existing account lacks a communication feature, we will deliver our written response to your designated email address.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
IX. Personal Information Sales and Sharing – Opt Out Rights
RealPage does
not
sell personal information collected through RealPage Services, and no such activity has occurred in the prior 12 months.
In the event that RealPage changes its practices and engages in the sale of personal information as regulated by law, we will provide advance notification to impacted individuals and offer the ability to opt in/opt out in accordance with regulatory requirements.
RealPage utilizes cookies and tracking technologies as set forth in the
Cookie Policy . Under some circumstances, these technologies may be deemed a “sharing” of personal information under applicable privacy laws. RealPage provides a
cookie preference center
to allow you to opt out and customize the cookies presented on our websites and services.
X. Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless permitted by law, we will not engage in any of the following practices in response to your exercise of privacy rights:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
XI. Other California Privacy Rights
The State of California also grants California residents privacy rights via laws unaffiliated with the CCPA/CPRA. Those rights include the following:
California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83)
permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@realpage.com.
California’s Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA – Civil code Section § 1786.10 -1786.40)
requires certain privacy disclosures related to investigate consumer reporting agencies operations, including the following:
Personal Information Disclosure: United States or Overseas
Personal information collected in connection with the provision of consumer reports and investigative consumer reports through our Resident Screening products (LeasingDesk and On-Site) is securely stored on servers located within the United States.
