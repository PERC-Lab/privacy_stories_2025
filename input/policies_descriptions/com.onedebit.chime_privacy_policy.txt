California residents also have additional rights as described in the
California and Virginia Rights
section below.  Right to Opt-Out / “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” .
The CCPA requires us to describe the categories of personal information we sell or share to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales. It is important to know that the definition of “sale” and “share” is very broad and the common flow of information for advertising and analytics may be considered a sale or sharing. Chime does not provide information that you might typically think of as personal information to third parties in exchange for money; however, under the CCPA, personal information includes unique identifiers, including things like IP addresses, cookie IDs, pixel tags, and mobile ad IDs. The law defines a “sale” broadly to include simply making such personal information available to third parties in some cases. “Share” is defined as providing personal information to a third party to target advertising to a consumer based on information about their activity on multiple websites across the internet. In the last 12 months, when you access our online services, we may let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, advertising IDs, and other unique identifiers, which may be collected along with device and usage data, and information about your interactions with our online services and advertisements.
Learn more about this opt-out on our FAQ page
here . We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. Learn more about how to opt-out in the “how to submit a request” section below.   Notice of Financial Incentive Chime may offer rewards or prizes for participation in certain activities that may be considered a “financial incentive” under California law. These activities may involve the collection of personal information. The categories of personal information we collect is limited to what information you provide us, but may include: identifiers, protected class/demographic information, commercial information, online activities, geolocation information (general and precise), sensory information, employment information, and inferences.  Activities we engage in that may be considered a financial incentive include surveys where we may provide compensation such as a gift card or SpotMe bonus in exchange for your time and responses, or a prize through your participation in promotions and sweepstakes. Participation in these programs may be subject to separate terms and conditions. Your participation in these programs is voluntary and you can terminate at any time as explained in any applicable terms. When we offer gift cards in exchange for your participation in a survey or when we engage in promotions or sweepstakes, the amount provided is reasonably related to the value of the data you provide, which takes into account a number of factors, including, the anticipated benefit we receive such as product improvement, better understanding how you use our products, to enhance our understanding of consumer and market trends, increased consumer engagement, and the anticipated expenses we incur in relation to the collection, storage, and use of the information we receive. The value may vary across surveys, promotions, and sweepstakes.

Alternatively, you can click on our “Do Not Sell or Share” link at the bottom of our homepage or use the Global Privacy Control signal described below, but these options will only be saved to your browser for the session which you are currently active in and will not change your account settings. Further, using these choices will not stop all interest-based advertising and will opt you out of sales and sharing only after the point in time at which you make your selection.  Global Privacy Control . You can also use the Global Privacy Control (GPC). Some browsers and browser extensions support the GPC or similar controls that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, including data sales and/or targeted advertising, as specified by applicable law. When we detect this signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your choices indicated by the GPC setting or similar control that is recognized by regulation or otherwise widely acknowledged as a valid opt-out preference signal.   Verifying Requests.
To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request (with the exception of a request to opt-out of sales). We may require you to provide any of the following information: your name, date of birth, the last four digits of your Social Security number, the email and physical addresses associated with your Chime account, one or more recent transactions, and the last four digits of one or more Chime-branded cards associated with your account. If you ask us to provide you with specific pieces of personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.   Retention of Personal Data.
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.    Additional Information.
If you choose to exercise any of your rights, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us. Except for the automated controls described above, if you send us a request to exercise your rights or these choices, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a fee or decline requests in certain cases. For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, or would interfere with a legal or business obligation that requires retention or use of the data. Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you receive a response from us informing you that we have declined your request, in whole or in part, you may appeal that decision by submitting your appeal to
support@chime.com . Please provide the state that you are writing from and include any documentation you may have regarding the matter that you are appealing.
