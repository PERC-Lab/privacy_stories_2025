T his Privacy Policy outlines the practices and policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by applications developed by us. It is important for app developers to provide clear and transparent information to users about how their personal data is handled. Here is a general framework for a privacy policy for applications . 1. Collection of Information: The collection of information refers to the process by which an application gathers data from its users. This data can be categorized into two main types: personal information and non-personal information. The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Link to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app: ●        Google Play Services ●        AdMob ●        Google Analytics for Firebase ●        Firebase Crashlytics ●        Facebook ●        One Signal a. Personal Information: Personal information refers to data that can be used to identify or contact an individual. When we collect personal information, it is important to inform users about the purpose for which the data is being collected and obtain their consent, particularly if it is sensitive information. Our App developer's should handle personal information with care and in compliance with applicable data protection laws. b. Non-Personal Information: Non-personal information, also known as anonymous or aggregate data, refers to information that does not directly identify an individual. Non-personal information is generally used to improve the app's functionality, enhance user experiences, and analyze usage patterns. While it does not directly identify individuals, it is still important to inform users about the collection and use of such data and offer options for users to opt out if desired. When describing the collection of information in a privacy policy, it is important to clearly state the types of information being collected (personal and non-personal), explain how the information is collected (through user input, device permissions, or other means), and disclose whether any third parties are involved in the data collection process. Providing transparency and obtaining user consent are key principles in handling and collecting information responsibly. 2. Use of Information: The purposes of information usage in an application can vary depending on the nature of the app and its features. The primary purpose of collecting user information is to deliver the core functionality of the application and enhance its performance. User data is often utilized to personalize and customize the user experience within the app. Collected data is frequently used for analytics and research purposes to improve the app's performance and user satisfaction. User information may be used for communication and support purposes & In some cases, user information may be utilized for marketing and promotional purposes. It's important to explicitly communicate these purposes to users in the privacy policy to ensure transparency and obtain their consent. Additionally, the privacy policy should clarify any specific data processing activities that may be unique to the app or required by applicable laws or regulations. 3. Data Storage and Security: Data storage and security are crucial aspects of maintaining user privacy and protecting their information & the security measures implemented to protect user data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. 4. User Choices and Control: User choices and control are important aspects of privacy that allow individuals to manage their personal information. Consider the following application consent and permissions: INTERNET AD_ID Log Data I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in the case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. Cookies Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service. Service Providers I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons: To facilitate our Service; To provide the Service on our behalf; To perform Service-related services; or To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose. Links to Other Sites: This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. 4. User Choices and Control: User choices and control are important aspects of privacy that allow individuals to manage their personal information. Consider the following application consent and permissions: It is crucial to provide clear instructions and easily accessible mechanisms for users to exercise their choices and control over their personal information. Empowering users to manage their privacy preferences helps build trust and promotes transparency in the app's data practices. 5. Children's Privacy: Children's privacy is an important consideration when developing an application, particularly when the app is intended for use by children or when it involves the collection of personal information from children. Clearly define the age range or criteria that define a child according to applicable laws or regulations, such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. It is essential to adhere to applicable laws and regulations when designing an app that targets children or collects personal information from them. By providing clear information and obtaining verifiable parental consent, the privacy of children can be safeguarded, promoting a safe and trusted environment for their digital interactions. These policies aim to ensure the safety and privacy of children and provide a positive and suitable experience for families using apps and games. Changes to this Privacy Policy We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements.
