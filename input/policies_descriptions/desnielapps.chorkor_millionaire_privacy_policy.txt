Dynamic websites contain information that changes, depending on the time of day, the viewer and other factors. They make use of both client-side and server-side scripts to create and update content. Client-side scripts, which run on a user�s computer, are mainly used for appearance and interaction purposes.

VPS Hosting (Virtual Private Server Hosting): In VPS hosting, every website is stored on a very powerful server that is divided into several virtual compartments. The server software is configured separately so that each unit can function independently. It should be your preferred option if you have high-security concerns but don�t want to invest in a faster (but costlier) dedicated server.

Shared Hosting: In shared hosting, you get to share the physical server with other website owners. However, you will have your own separate account (secured with login credentials). Shared hosting is very affordable because the cost of operating the server is shared between you and the other website owners.

The first thing to consider when starting your website is to choose a web hosting provider (if you already have a web domain1). The web hosting provider provides the web space (i.e. special computers called web servers) where your website files are stored, as well as the technologies and services needed for your website to be viewed on the Internet.
