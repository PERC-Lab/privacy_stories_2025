Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our websites and mobile applications. These technologies include first- and third-party cookies, web beacons, JavaScript, entity tags, and HTML local storage. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. For more information on exercising your preferences in relation to cookies and similar technologies, please see the section of this Notice titled “Your Choices & Rights”. Cookies
– Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for only the duration of your visit (“session cookies”) or for a fixed period (“persistent cookies”). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. You may be able to reject cookies, web beacons, entity tags and HTML5 local storage by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but many browsers have preferences or options that may be adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or installed, or allow you to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser or review the instructions provided by the following browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari Desktop, Safari Mobile; and Android browser. Interest-Based Ads
– Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where people can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each organization’s respective participating companies, visit the DAA’s opt-out portal available at
http://optout.aboutads.info/ , the DAA of Canada’s opt-out portal available at
https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools , or visit the NAI’s opt-out portal available at
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1 . Residents of the European Union may opt-out of online behavioral advertising served by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s participating member organizations by visiting
https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ . To opt-out of data collection for interest-based advertising across mobile applications by participating companies, download the DAA’s App Choices mobile application opt-out offering at
https://youradchoices.com/appchoices . Adobe Flash Player Technology
– We allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player. You cannot remove Flash cookies simply by changing your browser settings. If you would like to limit the websites that can store information in Flash cookies on your device, you must visit the Adobe website: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html Web Beacons
– Web beacons are small, transparent images that are embedded in web pages, applications, and emails that are sometimes called “clear gifs,” “single pixel gifs”, “page tags” or “web bugs.” We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an email has been opened and acted on. JavaScript
– JavaScript are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components. Entity Tags
-- Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. HTML5 Local Storage
– HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited. These and similar technologies are used for the following purposes: Services and Functionality
– Some of these technologies are required to allow you to access and use our websites or mobile applications and the various services and functionality we offer. Without these technologies, some of the services and functionality on our websites and mobile applications would not work properly. Performance Monitoring
– Some of these technologies help us analyze and estimate traffic and assess the volume of use of services and functionality on websites and mobile applications. They show us how visitors and customers interact with our digital properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to which certain web pages, applications, services or functionality are accessed and used and how they are performing or operating. When these technologies are used for performance monitoring, no directly identifiable information (e.g., your name, email address or phone number) is collected. User Convenience
– Some of these technologies enhance the ease of use of our websites and mobile applications and the services and functionality they make available by accelerating load and refresh times and remembering information that you have provided on prior visits to our websites or when you last used a website or mobile application service or functionality. Marketing
– Some of these technologies are used to tailor your experience on our website, within our mobile applications, or across your applications or devices by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you access or use these or other digital properties. Taken together, these technologies help us learn which services and functionality you are using and how you are accessing information about us. We may use this information to personalize your visit to a website or use of a mobile application or to send you relevant promotions and advertisements. 8. How We Protect Your Information Per Diem uses reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information. However, no security system is perfect, and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, including personal information, is absolutely safe from intrusion or other unauthorized access by others. You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and maintaining the security of your devices. 9. Retention Per Diem stores information as reasonably necessary and proportionate to accomplish the purposes identified in this Notice based on criteria such as the length of time we need to provide the services to you, and to meet legal requirements, including record retention, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Our retention of your information is governed by applicable law. The personal information that you provide us is stored and processed on servers owned by Per Diem and other companies in the United States, Canada or elsewhere around the world, including locations outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located. Regardless of the company or person who processes your information and where it is processed, we will take steps to transfer and protect your information through appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable data protection laws and this Notice. 10. Children’s Privacy We do not intend for our websites or online services to be used by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect, sell, or share information of consumers between the ages of 13 – 16.  If you are a parent or guardian and believe we may have collected information about your child, please contact us immediately as described in the “Contact Us” section of this Notice. For more information, please see our Terms of Use.  13. Your Choices & Rights (a)  Your Choices Location Services
– In order to use certain Per Diem Services, such as mobile order and pay (“MOP”) and location-based services and technology, you must either (a) enable “location services” in the Per Diem App; and/or (b) set the permissions in your mobile device to allow communication of this information. If you allow for location sharing, your device may communicate with us in ways that allow for us to customize your experience in and around Per Diem stores, to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to tailor messages based on your time and location patterns, and to limit the number of times you see a promotional message or offer. Precise geolocation may be used to fulfill services and application functionality you choose to engage with. You can manage the use of that personal information at any time in your device settings. For most mobile devices, you can disable the collection of geolocation information by turning off location services on your device.  If you have any questions about how to prevent Per Diem from collecting your geolocation, we recommend you contact your mobile device service provider or the device manufacturer. Certain Per Diem App features and some Per Diem Services may not work properly without information about your location. You can re-enable the collection of geolocation information, at any time, by turning on location services on your device. Voice Ordering –

(c)  Other California Rights If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information we have shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

Box 20430, Augusta, GA 30916 Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” preference that transmits a “Do Not Track” header to the websites you visit with information indicating that you do not want your activity to be tracked. We currently do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals, as there is no standard for how online services should respond to such signals. As standards develop, we may develop policies for responding to do-not-track signals that we will describe in this Notice. 14. Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in the EEA, the U.K., and Switzerland This section provides general information about how Per Diem collects, stores, uses, transfers and otherwise processes personal data in or from certain countries in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (together, for purposes of this section of this Notice, “EEA”), in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its local implementations. This section does not supersede the applicability of any privacy policy found on the website of an EEA-based Per Diem affiliate with whom you have engaged, as that entity would be the data controller with respect to your personal data and the entity to which your data subject rights requests should be directed. (a)  Lawful Bases of Processing
– Where a Per Diem entity is acting as a data controller that determines the purposes and means of processing your personal data, such as when we collect, use, and share personal data as described in this Notice, we must have a lawful basis for processing for doing so. Our lawful bases for processing personal data include: to conclude or perform a contract with you, for example to: process your purchases of or requests for products and services, including delivering gift cards in accordance with your instructions; communicate with you about orders, purchases, returns, services, accounts, programs, contests, and sweepstakes; for our legitimate business purposes, including to: respond to your customer service inquiries and requests for information; maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, mobile applications, ads, and the products and services we offer; detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud; and facilitate the functionality of our websites and mobile applications; to comply with our legal obligations, for example to maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes and as required by applicable law, and provide important product safety information and notice of product recalls; and on the basis of your consent, for example to send you via email and other electronic means personalized promotions and special offers or informing you about our brands, products, events, or other promotional purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time by modifying your promotional preferences in your Per Diem user account online, or by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below. (b)  Your EEA Data Subject Rights
– Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to: Request access
to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Request correction
of the personal information that we hold about you. Request erasure
of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Object to processing
of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), or where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. Request the restriction of processing
of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you. Request the transfer
of your personal information to another party, when possible. Not be subject to automated decision-making
producing legal or significant effects on an individual, which we do not engage in. To exercise any of these rights, please see the “Your Choices & Rights” section, or contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below and specify which GDPR privacy right(s) you wish to exercise. We must verify your identity in order to honor your request, which we will respond to within 30 days of receipt. (c)  Retention
– As described in the “Retention” section, as a general rule, we keep your data for only as long as it is needed to complete the purpose for which it was collected or as required by law. We may need to keep your data for longer than our specified retention periods to honor your requests, including to continue keeping you opted out of marketing emails, or to comply with legal, regulatory, accounting or other obligations. (d)  Transfers Outside the EEA
– Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States.  It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for Per Diem or for our third-party service providers. In such cases, we will take appropriate steps to ensure an adequate level of data protection of the recipient as required under the GDPR and as described in this Notice. (e)  Complaints
– If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EEA supervisory authority (link). We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to first address your concerns and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us per the “Contact Us” section below, or to our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
You may also contact our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) at any time at support@tryperdiem.com. 15. Participation in the Privacy Shield Frameworks On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a transfer mechanism for data between EU and U.S. companies. On September 8, 2020, the Swiss supervisory authority similarly announced that it no longer considered the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as adequate for personal data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S. Per Diem Corporation will utilize alternate appropriate safeguards going forward for such data transfers. Even though the Privacy Shield Frameworks have been invalidated, Per Diem will continue to honor its commitments with respect to EU and Swiss personal data transfer pursuant to Privacy Shield prior to the respective Frameworks’ invalidation. Per Diem Corporation participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. Per Diem is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom in reliance on the Privacy Shield Frameworks, to the applicable Principles. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at
https://www.privacyshield.gov/list . Per Diem is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf, under the Privacy Shield Framework. Per Diem complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, the U.K., and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Per Diem is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Per Diem may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request . Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint , you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. 16.
