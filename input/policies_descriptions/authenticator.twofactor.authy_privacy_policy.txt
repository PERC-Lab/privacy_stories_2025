HOW INFORMATION IS USED, SHARED AND DISCLOSED DuyHt does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent. Except as set forth in Section 10 of this Privacy Policy, parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as DuyHt does not share information that may be collected from your child. DuyHt uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the DuyHt Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of DuyHt's business. Examples of how DuyHt shares and discloses your information is as follows: Legal. DuyHt may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise DuyHt's legal rights. DuyHt may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when DuyHt believes that disclosure is necessary to protect DuyHt's rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. DuyHt may share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of DuyHt's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law. Business Transfers. As DuyHt continues to develop its business, DuyHt may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of DuyHt's assets are acquired or DuyHt merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that DuyHt reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, DuyHt will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control. DuyHt may use third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on DuyHt's behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, processing payments, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. DuyHt will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. DuyHt shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this Privacy Policy. 4. SECURITY The security of your Personal Information is important to DuyHt. DuyHt follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to DuyHt, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, DuyHt cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security system is completely secure, DuyHt and its third-party partners and vendors take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by DuyHt. For DuyHt, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information is disclosed only on a "need to know" basis and ensuring that all Personal Information collected by DuyHt is done so via secured connections and protected and encrypted (using secure socket layer technology,"SSL") by industrial grade security software to guard against unauthorized access. 5. ADVERTISING DuyHt partners with third parties to display advertising throughout the Services or to manage its advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests if you are older than 13, and contextual advertising if you are younger than 13. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads. 6. SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES AND TOOLS The DuyHt Services may include integrated social media features and tools, such as the Facebook "Like" button, the YouTube "Share This" button, and interactive mini-programs that run in the DuyHt Services. These Features may collect information on your IP address, which page you are visiting on DuyHt's site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media features and tools are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on the DuyHt Services. Your interactions with these integrated social media features and tools are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 7. GOOGLE+ OR OTHER OPENID PROVIDER You may be able to log in to some of DuyHt's mobile applications using sign-in services such as Google+ or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with DuyHt such as your name and email address to pre-populate DuyHt's sign up form. Services like Google+ give you the option to post information about your activities on the DuyHt website to your profile page to share with others within your network. 8. LINKS TO OTHER SITES The DuyHt Services contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by DuyHt. Please be aware that DuyHt is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
