Privacy Policy
Parents as Teachers National Center, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “PATNC”) provides several websites as a public service to our users. Your privacy is important to us. It is Parents as Teachers’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you our websites. We strongly recommend that you read the Privacy Policy carefully. By using any of our web sites, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of the Privacy Policy, you are directed to discontinue accessing or otherwise using the web sites or any materials obtained from them. If you are dissatisfied with the web site, by all means contact us; otherwise, your only recourse is to disconnect from this site and refrain from visiting the site in the future. The process of maintaining a web site is an evolving one, and PATNC may decide at some point in the future, without advance notice, to modify the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your use of the web site, or materials obtained from the web site, indicates your assent to the Privacy Policy at the time of such use. The effective Privacy Policy will be posted on the web site, and you should review the Privacy Policy upon every visit for any changes.
Sites Covered by this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to all the PATNC-maintained web sites, domains, information portals, and registries, including: https://parentsasteachers.org, https://parentsasteachersconference.org, https://ebiz.patnc.org, and https://parentsasteachers.sabacloud.com/.
Children’s Privacy
PATNC is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. PATNC does not intentionally collect information from minors, and does not target its web site to children.
Links to Non-PATNC Web Sites
PATNC’s web sites may provide links to third-party web sites for the convenience of our users. If you access those links, you will leave PATNC’s web site. PATNC does not control these third-party websites, and cannot represent that their policies and practices will be consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, other web sites may collect or use personal information about you in a manner different from as described in this document. Therefore, you should use third-party web sites with caution, and you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any third-party web site before submitting personal information.
Types of Information We Collect
Non-Personal Information
Non-personal information is data about usage and service operation that is not directly associated with a specific personal identity. PATNC may collect and analyze non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use PATNC’s web sites.
Aggregate Information
PATNC may gather aggregate information, which refers to information your computer automatically provides to us, and that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after our site), the pages viewed, time spent at our web site, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns, and for purposes of system administration.
Log Files
Every time you request or download a file from the web site, PATNC may store data about these events, and your IP address, in a log file. PATNC may use this information to analyze trends, administer the web site, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, or for other business purposes.
Cookies
Our site may use a feature of your browser to set a “cookie” on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information that a web site’s computer stores on your computer. PATNC’s web sites can then read the cookies whenever you visit our site. We may use cookies in a number of ways, such as to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our web site, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to track the pages you’ve visited. These cookies allow us to use the information we collect to customize your experience, so that your visit to our site is as relevant and as valuable to you as possible.
Most browser software can be set up to deal with cookies. You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of our web site may not work properly, and you may be unable to use those of PATNC’s services that require registration in order to participate, or you may have to reregister each time you visit our site. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. We do not link non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable information without your permission.
Web Beacons
PATNC’s web site may also use web beacons to collect non-personal information about your use of our web site and the web sites of selected sponsors or members, your use of special promotions or newsletters, and other activities. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our web site, how many people open our emails, and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our web site. PATNC does not link non-personal information from web beacons to personally identifiable information without your permission.
Personal Information
Personal information is information that is associated with your name or personal identity. PATNC uses personal information to provide you with services you have requested. On some of PATNC’s web pages, you may be able to request information, subscribe to mailing lists, or request services. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, phone numbers, e-mail address, income, identification information, or other personal information. Personal information, including credit card information, may be collected for the purpose of purchases or donations. Credit Card numbers are not stored in our system. They are encoded and forwarded to PayPal (our payment processing vendor) using tokens which only PayPal can interpret. To enable the discussions and networking facilitated by the https://parentsasteachers.sabacloud.com/ website, referred to as O.L.I.V.E.R., your group activity is visible to other users in the system.
How We Use Your Information
PATNC may use non-personal data that is aggregated for reporting about the PATNC’s web site usability, performance, and effectiveness. It may be used to improve the experience, usability, and content of the site. PATNC may use personal information to provide services that the user has requested. In providing these services, PATNC may need to share personal information with third-party organizations. Those organizations may only use your personal information for purposes directly related to the service requested. Credit card information may be collected to facilitate the processing of online donations; if you purchase a product or service from our website, such information will not be kept longer than necessary in order to provide the services requested. Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for other purposes. Payment processing services may be provided by a third-party payment service, and a management company external to PATNC may provide support for the financial activities of PATNC. PATNC may share your personal information with its partners to facilitate these transactions. Those partners are not allowed to use your information for any purpose other than facilitating the transaction you have requested.
Information Sharing
PATNC does not sell, rent, or lease any individual’s personal information or lists of email addresses to anyone for marketing purposes, and we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of this information. However, PATNC reserves the right to supply any such information to any organization into which the PATNC may merge in the future, or to which it may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue part or all of its mission. We also reserve the right to release personal information to protect our systems or business, when we have reasonable cause to believe a user has initiated or participated in any illegal activity. In addition, please be aware that in certain circumstances, PATNC may be obligated to release your personal information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or other orders.
Security
PATNC makes every effort to protect personal information by users of the web site, including using firewalls and other security measures on its servers. No server, however, is 100% secure, and you should take this into account when submitting personal or confidential information about yourself on any web site, including this one. PATNC assumes no liability for the interception, alteration, or misuse of the information you provide. You alone are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please use care when use access this web site and providing personal information.

From time to time, PATNC may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys, or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements.
