PLEASE REVIEW THE PRIVACY POLICY OUTLINED BELOW BEFORE UTILIZING
OUR APP. BY ENGAGING WITH OUR APP OR SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS
OUTLINED IN THIS POLICY. SHOULD YOU DISAGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE
REFRAIN FROM USING OUR APP AND SERVICES. BE AWARE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY CAN
BE UPDATED PERIODICALLY. CONTINUING TO USE OUR SERVICES POST-UPDATES IMPLIES

Your necessary information may be collected for different
purposes, including:
1. This application has or will have features
such as AI beautification, AI painting, photo quality enhancement, and others
that necessitate the use of deep learning technology. Due to the intensity of
this technology, images may be uploaded to our high-performance server. If the
app requires access to your device's photo library, it will seek your
permission.
(1) While this app may need to upload and
process your images for feature functionality, the process is encrypted and
compliant with legal standards as required to ensure the security of your
information.
(2) Your information is used solely for the
app's functions. Post-processing, images are deleted within 24 hours, while
images created using the app are removed after 15 days. The technology
implemented in the application does not allow for unique identification or
authentication of individual users.
(3)
Publicly available datasets or legally obtained datasets are
used for refining our deep learning features. Your images won't be utilized for
anything outside of the intended user features.
(4) Please ensure you possess legal rights for
uploaded content. If not, you will be responsible for all consequences and
losses caused.
(5) Without explicit consent, no information
from this article will be shared, unless mandated by law or required to
safeguard the interests of the app, its users, or the general public.
2. To enhance user experience, we utilize tools
like Google Firebase, Google AdMob, and Meta for fault correction, illegal use
prevention, and feature usage statistics collection. This data isn't
user-specific but is aggregated from all users.
3. For user assistance, we collect your
identification and communication details. This information is solely for
support and is deleted within a year post case resolution.
4. To analyze your interaction, interests, and
behaviors within our products.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
Information You Provide
1. When you engage with our services, we
collect certain personal details you willingly share – including name,
username, email, phone number, and date of birth – crucial for service
delivery. This data helps us offer app features, respond to your communications,
and resolve any application-related concerns. Photos uploaded for edits are not
disclosed unless we receive clear consent to display them on our platforms or
third-party services.
2. Our app's functioning relies on gathering
user actions like downloads, shares, editing activities, and other interactions
to understand and enhance user experience.
3. Using your SIM card or IP address details,
we pinpoint your approximate location to curate tailored content for you. For a
seamless and secure app experience, we collect data related to your device and
its usage. This encompasses unique device identifiers, software version number,
access network, network quality data, MAC address, operating system, system
version number, IP address, GUID, device model, system language, country,
advertising identifier and service log information. Such data assists in
refining your interaction with advertisements and the app overall.
4. Both IDFA (found on iPhones or iPads) and
AAID (present on Android devices) serve as unique device identifiers. These are
given by your device's operating system, permitting advertisers to identify and
track users for advertising-related activities. If you wish to disable such
tracking, here's how you can do it:
For iOS and iPadOS 14.5 and
later: Navigate to Settings. Choose Privacy. Select Tracking. From there, you
can toggle on or off the option that says "Allow Apps to Request to
Track". Additionally, you can manage tracking permissions for specific apps.
For older iOS or iPadOS versions: Go to Settings. Head to Privacy. Click on
Advertising. Activate the "Limit Ad Tracking" button. By following
these steps, you can gain more control over how advertisers track your
activities on your device.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We collect various types of information to
enhance your app experience. This might encompass details like the kind of
mobile device you employ, its unique ID, your device's IP address, general
location data, mobile OS, the internet browsers you prefer, search queries, and
your overall application usage patterns. To gain insights into user behavior,
recognize trends, and fine-tune our app, we utilize third-party analytics tools
like Google Firebase and periodically sample user data. This process helps us
align our services better with customer needs.
Use of SDKs
To enhance our app's functionality, we
integrate third-party software development kits (SDKs). These SDKs enable our
advertising partners to gather data directly from our app, optimizing online
advertising across different platforms and services. If any updates to these
SDKs arise, we'll incorporate them, ensuring continuous protection of your data
privacy.
Machine Learning, Cloud and Server Handling
For our machine learning capabilities, we rely
on open datasets and data that has been legally acquired. Importantly, user
images are not utilized for training or enhancing our features. Furthermore,
during your engagement with our service, we commit that no User Content will be
gathered or harnessed by us for service improvements or any other intent.
When utilizing features that necessitate server
support, only the photos you explicitly choose for editing are uploaded to the
cloud. We collaborate with a third-party cloud provider, Alibaba Cloud, for the
processing and refining of photos. During this editing phase, your data is
temporarily held on the cloud server and is safeguarded using encryption, with
the key securely stored on your device. Importantly, these uploaded photos
remain private and are only accessible if you, the user, decide to share them.
INFORMATION SHARING
We may share your information in the following
ways:
(1) Service Enhancement: We use the gathered
information to refine our services and enrich the user experience. This
includes monitoring overarching metrics like overall visitor count, traffic
trends, and user demographics.
(2) Collaboration with Third-party Partners: We
share non-personal data with trusted third-party partners who pledge adherence
to relevant laws regarding their data use. These partners might further share
this data with their affiliates. The main goals for this sharing are to refine
their services and to serve you tailored advertisements and product/service
recommendations, taking into account factors such as your location and
interaction levels.
(3) Within the bounds of the law, we might
disclose your information to legal or governmental bodies or private entities.
Such disclosure would be driven by the need to: Investigate and counteract
claims, comply with legal processes, such as subpoenas, safeguard our or a
third party's rights and property, protect against potential legal liabilities,
ensure the safety of the public or individuals, prevent actions that are
illegal, unethical, or legally questionable, preserve the security or the
integrity of our service and associated infrastructure.
(4) Business Transfers: Should there be any
significant business transitions – like mergers, acquisitions, asset sales,
reorganizations, or if facing bankruptcy – we may decide to transfer or share
some or all of our assets. In such scenarios, if the succeeding entity's
intended data processing diverges significantly from this Privacy Policy,
you'll be provided an option to withdraw from such data transfer.
INFORMATION SECURITY AND RETENTION
We prioritize the safety of our app users' data
and are dedicated to implementing measures aimed at guarding the information
from unauthorized access or potential loss. Nonetheless, it's essential to
understand that no security system can guarantee absolute protection. The
channels and systems you use to engage with our services might sometimes face
security breaches or malfunctions, often due to factors beyond our control.
In line with our Policy, your data might be
stored or transferred either within your country or to another location.
Entrusting us with your information implies your consent to this transfer,
storage, or processing. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your
data is treated securely and in alignment with this Policy and the relevant
laws.
Typically, we retain your personal information
for as long as it serves the purpose for which it was collected – be it
delivering our services or for legal reasons, like regulatory compliance and
addressing disputes. Once the information no longer serves a purpose, we'll
usually either erase it or anonymize it. However, it's important to note that
certain data might need to be stored for specific durations, as mandated by
legal stipulations.
UPDATES
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy
Policy occasionally for various reasons. Whenever changes are made, we will
make the updated Policy available on our website and highlight the "Last
modified" date at the beginning of the document. We encourage you to
periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about any
modifications. Your ongoing use of the app after any updates signifies your
acceptance of these changes.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY PROTECTION
Our applications are not designed to solicit or
collect personal data from children under the age of 13. To access and utilize
our services, users must affirm that they are at least 13 years old. In
instances where we inadvertently obtain information from a child below this age
threshold, we will take immediate steps to delete that data from our systems.
Moreover, we strongly advise minors aged 13 and older to obtain parental
consent before sharing any personal details online.
