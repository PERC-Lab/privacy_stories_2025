Who We Are
Who We are | ValleyStar Credit Union
We Speak Your Language.
All across Virginia, ValleyStar Credit Union has been serving businesses and families like yours since 1953. It’s our mission to make banking and managing your finances as easy and convenient as possible. We want to get beyond the dry language of mortgages, loans, accounts and credit cards to what you really care about – the house you’d love to own, the bigger car, the credit card that works with your lifestyle, reaching that goal of a law degree, owning a small business or a secure retirement. If you can dream it, we can help you achieve it.
We are also committed to supporting and serving the communities where you live and work so that, together, we can strive to lead better, more financially secure lives.
People Just Like You.
When you speak to a ValleyStar employee, you’ll understand right away what makes us different. Not only do we speak your language, we listen. We all have goals and our goal is to figure out the smartest and easiest way for you to achieve yours. We’re always trying to be better to help make your life better.

Why a Credit Union?
There are so many reasons to bank with a credit union, but the main difference is simple: unlike most other financial institutions, credit unions do not issue stock or pay dividends to outside stockholders. Instead, earnings are returned to members in the form of lower loan rates, higher interest on deposits, and lower fees. So, the bottom line is your bottom line. With credit unions, you get less charges and more value.
