Internet Banking and Mobile App are disabled
The process of converting to our new core has started.  You will no longer have access to online banking, bill pay, and your current mobile banking app is now disconnected.  Feel free to delete that app at this time.  You may go to the app store, or the google play store, to download the new Wanda State Bank App, but as a reminder this app WILL NOT WORK until Monday after 9:00 a.m. The new app and new online banking site will accept your current user ID and password.
