Service Cancellation
iTrust Ventures’s cancellation policy for specific Services is as follows: Cancellation by Customer. As a Customer, you may cancel your scheduled Service appointments through the App or by contacting your iTrust Ventures at any time, subject to the following: Services Booked 24 Hours in Advance If you cancel more than 24 hours before a scheduled Service appointment, there is no cancellation fee. If you cancel between 2-24 hours before a scheduled Service appointment, you may be charged a $10.00 cancellation fee. If you cancel less than 2 hours before a Service appointment, you may be charged a $50.00 cancelation fee. Services Booked Less 24 Hours in Advance For Services that were booked between 2-24 hours before the scheduled Service appointment, you may be charged a $10 cancellation fee if you cancel less than 2 hours before a Service appointment. Cancellation by Provider. As a Provider, although you may cancel your scheduled Service appointments through the App if necessary, please understand that your cancellations are serious matters and may result in the suspension or deactivation of your Provider Account. If you are more than 15 minutes late for a scheduled appointment (note: the scheduled time for a “Now” appointment is 1 hour from the time you are selected by your Customer) or fail to complete a scheduled Service, you shall be deemed to have cancelled such appointment. When you cancel a scheduled Service appointment, the iTrust Ventures Platform generally notifies your Customer to resubmit the request for Service. iTrust Ventures cannot guarantee that a cancelled Service appointment will be selected by another Provider and rescheduled or that the Service request will be completed. Thus, your cancellation or failure to timely show up to perform a scheduled appointment could negatively impact your Customer and the iTrust Ventures Platform. As a result, such conduct may adversely impact your rating among Customers. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT YOUR CANCELLATION OF (A) ANY “NOW” APPOINTMENTS, (B) ANY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS ON LESS THAN 24 HOURS NOTICE, OR (C) TWO OR MORE SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS WITHIN A 30-DAY PERIOD IS A VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE SUSPENSION OR DEACTIVATION OF YOUR PROVIDER ACCOUNT.
