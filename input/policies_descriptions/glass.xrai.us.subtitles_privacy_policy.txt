XRAI Glass is a companion software application (“XRAI Glass”), which pairs with Augmented Reality Glasses (the “Device”), designed for use by hearing impaired individuals to transcribe and translate audio recordings into plain text and overlay captioned text boxes on to users’ live visual interactions with other individuals.
For users subscribing to XRAI Glass’ premium tier (or a trial of the premium tier), Audio Content will be shared with third-party cloud services providers to deliver transcription, translation and personal assistant functionalities. Otherwise, all Audio Content is processed locally on a user’s mobile device for the period in which XRAI Glass is open (the “Session”). Once a Session has ended, all Audio Content is automatically deleted from a user’s mobile device, if the user has enabled record session audio in the settings, then the audio content will remain on-device.

Retention Period
We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, for example, for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Platforms to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Platforms); (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
Where a legal obligation arises or retention is advisable in light of our legal position, in some circumstances, we will retain certain Personal Information, even after your account has been deleted and/or we no longer provide the Platforms to you; for example:
To cooperate with law enforcement or public, regulatory and government authorities:
If we receive a preservation order or search warrant related to your Platforms account, we will preserve Personal Information subject to such order or warrant after you delete your Platforms account.

To pursue or defend a legal action:
We may retain relevant Personal Information in the event of a legal claim or complaint, including regulatory investigations or legal proceedings about a claim related to your Personal Information, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation (whether in respect of our relationship with you or otherwise) after the dispute has been settled or decided by a court or tribunal from which there is no further right of appeal.
Third-party services
This Privacy Notice does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which the Platforms link. The inclusion of a link on the Platforms does not imply any endorsement of the linked site or service by us.
The Platforms may provide functionality allowing you to make payments to the Company using third-party payment services with which you have created your own account. When you use such a service to make a payment to us, your Personal Information will be collected by such a third party and not by us and will be subject to the third party’s privacy notice rather than this Privacy Notice. We have no control over and are not responsible for this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information.
In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Google, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps or our Social Media Pages.

Jurisdiction and Cross-Border Transfer

Where this will involve transferring your Personal Information outside the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
Adequacy Decisions:
Some non-UK countries are recognized by the Secretary of State as providing an adequate level of data protection according to UK standards (the full list of these countries is available
here ).
Standard Contractual Clauses:
If we transfer Personal Information from the UK to countries which are not considered adequate under the UK GDPR, we have put in place the UK’s international data transfer agreement for international data transfers (the “ UK IDTA ”) to protect your Personal Information. You may obtain a copy of the UK IDTA by contacting us in accordance with the “ Contacting Us ” section below or by following this
link . “ UK GDPR ” has the meaning given to it in section 3(10) (as supplemented by section 205(4)) of the Data Protection Act 2018.
Sensitive Information
Unless we request it, we ask that you not send us, and you do not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership) on or through the Platforms or otherwise to us.
Updates to this Privacy Notice
The “Last Updated” legend at the top of this Privacy Notice indicates when this Privacy Notice was last revised.
