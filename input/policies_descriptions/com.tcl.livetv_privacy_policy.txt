We and

similar web technologies including pixel tags or web beacons, (“automated

other websites and applications operated by us. Automated collection tools are
pieces of code deployed on your device. The automated collection tools allow

§

us to provide products and services to you and manage transactions. For
example, we may deploy a cookie to remember what items you have stored in an
online shopping basket; and
§
For
certain content management and editing purposes.
Persistent
cookies do not expire when you close your browser. We use persistent cookies:
§
To record
whether a visitor is logged in to the TCL account;
§
To record
when a visitor to the TCL account or other TCL website / application gives
consent to our use of cookies, when applicable;
§
For
performance and design purposes. For example, we might use cookies to track
which parts of our websites or applications are popular and to figure out how
to improve their functionality;
§
To
improve user experience and personalise what you see. For example, we might use
cookies to record user preferences and to ensure that more relevant website /
application content (including advertising content) is delivered to users;
§
To enable
us and third-party partners that we work with to deliver advertisements or
tailor marketing messages that you have consented to receive. For example, we
may use cookies to record what products and services you buy or show interest
in and use third party services to enable relevant advertisements to be shown
on our and other websites / applications based on that information; and
§
For
certain content management and editing purposes.
How
to Manage Automated Collection Tools
If you
do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or
to alert you when a cookie is placed on your device. You may also delete
cookies as soon as you leave the TCL account or other TCL website /
application. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit the
TCL account, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to
use all of the features and functionality of the TCL account or other TCL
website/application.
For
example, the Help portion of the toolbar on most web browsers will tell you how
to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
notify you when you receive a new automated collection tools, and how to
entirely disable automated collection tools. With regards to some of the
popular browsers you can find more information by clicking on the following
relevant links:
Google Chrome ;
Microsoft Edge ;
Mozilla Firefox
;
Microsoft Internet
Explorer

Opera
and
Apple Safari
.
Where
required by applicable laws,
we
will present you with a cookie banner the first time you visit our
website/application that explains what type of automated collection tools we
use and which asks your consent for some of the automated collection tools we
use.
Personal
Data Collected through Automated Collection Tools
We use
the Personal Data collected through automated collection tools for the purposes
specified above (including in the Section “Uses of Personal Data”). For those
cookies where we ask for your consent to deploy them, we also rely on consent
as the legal basis for processing Personal Data collected through those
cookies.
For
U.S. users, the Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt-out
of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit

opting-out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does
