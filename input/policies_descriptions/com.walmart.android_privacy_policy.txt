We use personal information to provide you with products and services and to operate and improve our business. For example, we use it for: Performing services, including maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytics services, providing storage, or providing similar services Performing and providing advertising and marketing services, including targeted advertising To conduct auditing and monitoring of transactions and engagement, including auditing related to counting ad impressions to unique visitors, verifying positioning and quality of ad impressions, and auditing compliance Short-term, transient use, such as non-personalized advertising shown as part of your current interaction with us Helping to ensure security and integrity and prevent fraud Undertaking activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of our services or devices and to improve, upgrade, or enhance them Debugging to identify and repair errors Conducting business analysis, such as analytics, projections, identifying areas for operational improvement Conducting research and development, including undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration Fulfilling our legal functions or obligations To the extent we process deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information unless permitted by applicable law.
How Do We Collect Personal Information?
We may obtain and combine personal information from different sources, collected online and offline, including information from third-party sources across different types of technology and devices. Provided Directly by You or a Member of Your Household When you visit us in our stores or online, you may share different types of personal information with us when you engage in the activities below: Conduct a transaction in-store or online, or request a service where we collect information (including when required by law, such as alcohol sales or hunting and fishing licenses) Create an account on one of our websites or mobile services Use a gift registry or create a mobile shopping list Participate in our programs, such as Walmart Pay or Walmart+ Request customer service or contact us Interact with various types of technologies, applications and features, including our chatbot Post a rating, review or other user-generated content on one of our websites or mobile services, or post a review or comment on one of our social media pages Participate in a contest, sweepstake, promotion, or survey Use features of our websites or mobile services that enable us, with your consent, to access the camera, microphone, or contacts on your computer or mobile device to provide you with functionality, such as voice search, scanning bar codes for online search or mobile scan & go, or importing your mobile contacts. You must give us your permission before we access these features, and you can opt out of providing access to them at any time by adjusting the settings on your device. In addition to the above, we may use your device’s camera to provide virtual services such as eyeglass virtual try-on services and pupillary measurements. To use this feature, either you are at least the legal age of the jurisdiction (e.g., state) in which you reside or you have obtained parental or guardian consent. You (or your parents/guardians) are given the option to consent to the collection and use of your biometric information as described here, or decline use of the service, before we use your device’s camera for this service. If you use this service, your device’s camera (e.g., Apple’s TrueDepth camera) uses facial scanning technology to measure your unique features so we can virtually place eyeglass frames over the image of your face. To do this, we collect your biometric information and disclose it to our authorized service provider for processing. Any biometric data we collect from you will be deleted within 48 hours and will be used solely for the purpose of enabling you to see yourself wearing virtual eyeglass frames. If you use the Walmart shopping voice assistant within the Walmart app, and consent to microphone and speech recognition, Walmart will have access to your microphone when the Walmart app is open and will continually listen for the key words “Hey, Walmart” to wake up your assistant. Walmart does not retain any information prior to recognizing the “Hey, Walmart” utterance, and only uses information collected after hearing that utterance for limited purposes such as providing the service, maintaining the quality or safety of the service, or fulfilling other internal business purposes, or our legal or compliance obligations. Collected Through Automated Means We may obtain personal information about you such as device and online identifiers and internet or other network activity information via automated means through your use of technology, such as when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications or services, or click on advertisements or links in emails you receive from us. Also, depending on your device’s settings, we may collect precise geolocation information. You can control our ability to do this by adjusting the location-sharing settings on your mobile device at any time. You also may adjust your mobile device’s Bluetooth settings to disable the sharing of Bluetooth location-related data. Your mobile device’s GPS signal allows us to show you the Walmart stores closest to you. It also lets us know when you are about to arrive to pick up your Online Grocery Pickup order after you check in. We may be able to recognize the location of your mobile device in our stores when you are in a store where we provide free WiFi access or through the use of Bluetooth technology. Through mobile services, Bluetooth technology in our stores allows us to show you nearby products that may interest you, making it easier for you to locate products within, and navigate through, the store.  Collected Through In-Store Technology We may collect your personal information from technology we use in our stores. For example, our point-of-sale terminals process your credit card information when you complete your purchase, and we operate in-store cameras for security and operational purposes, such as to help deter theft or improve store design to better serve our customers. Obtained from Other Companies within Our Corporate Family We may obtain your personal information from another company within our corporate family, such as Sam's Club. Obtained from External Third-Party Sources We may obtain personal information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our services, increase the appeal and relevance of advertising, and to prevent or detect fraud. We also may obtain device and browsing information, from third parties for marketing purposes. Collected from Another Solution or Asset For example,
when you speak to customer service, we collect your personal information using call recording technology in accordance with applicable law.
