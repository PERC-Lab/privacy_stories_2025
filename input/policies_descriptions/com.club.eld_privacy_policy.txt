PAYMENT DEMANDS AND TERMS
The services are paid off after the payment from you is credited to the Club ELD account. If you are
making a payment, you agree to provide us with valid payment information.
Please note, that if the currency of the payment differs from the currency of your savings on your
bank account, the money will have to be converted in currency. Therefore, before you proceed with the
payment, please check the current real exchange rate with your bank.
For your convenience, we give you the opportunity to make transactions using a number of different
sources of financing, such as credit and debit cards, other payment methods.
The methods of payment used by us may vary depending on your country and may be changed by us at any
time at our sole discretion.
Please note that we may use the services of third-party payment processors to process your payments. Before
making a payment, carefully study the details of the transaction, since the total cost may include commissions,
taxes, fees and other mandatory payments established by third parties that you will be required to pay.
IF YOU HAVE NOT REACHED THE AGE OF MAJORITY, YOU CAN MAKE A PURCHASE USING ONE OR ANOTHER PAYMENT METHOD, ONLY WITH
THE PERMISSION OF ONE OF YOUR PARENTS OR GUARDIAN.
When making a payment, you give us (and our special payment systems) permission to debit the full
amount from the payment data that you specify for the operation. You also give us permission to collect and
store payment data along with other transaction information. In addition, we can use certain services for
updating payment card details, the availability of which depends on the issuer, so that the information on
payment data stored with us is always up to date.
If you pay by credit or debit card, we can obtain from the card issuer prior approval of payment in an
amount that may equal its full value. Funds will be debited from your card at the time of payment initiation
or shortly after it. If you cancel the operation before it is completed, the transaction amount may not be
returned to you immediately due to the need to obtain the approval mentioned above. If the debit operation
leads to an overdraft or the collection of other bank charges from you, you are solely responsible for the
specified obligations to the bank.
When you use any form of payment, you represent and warrant to Club ELD that:
You are the legal owner of this payment method and have the right to use it;
The payment method you use is valid.
The use of such a payment method and the initiation of payments in the Club ELD are carried out in
accordance with the law applicable to you.
Measures we can take:
We may deny you the right to make payments in the Club ELD at any time at our discretion.
We may cancel any transaction if it seems to us that it violates this Privacy policy or such
cancellation can prevent financial losses.
In order to avoid financial losses that you or we may suffer, we have the right to postpone the payment
for some time, restrict the possibility of using payment data for a transaction, or the possibility of making
a payment, or deactivate your account.
In order to avoid financial losses that you or we may suffer, we have the right to contact the issuer
or the source of your payment data, law enforcement agencies or interested third parties (including other
users), and exchange information with them about any payments related to you, if we proceed from the
assumption that this will prevent financial loss or violation of the law.
We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your use of the paid services of the Club ELD at any time
and for any reason without any obligations.
If you suspect that an unauthorized or other improper transaction has been made under your account, you
must immediately notify us to prevent financial losses. If you missed a notice or complaint from the 10-day
deadline, we have the right to refuse to consider any claims against us in connection with certain

DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION
Club ELD is a provincially regulated entity in Tennessee, USA.
You and Club ELD agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Club ELD arising in connection
with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Club ELD as a user of the Service (whether
based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise
during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including
attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but
the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive the termination of the Agreements.

party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to
the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that period. If applicable
law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest
time permitted by applicable law.
