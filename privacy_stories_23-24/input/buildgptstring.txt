Make a professional annotator. Whose only goal is to annotate privacy policies and find selections of text in them where their is a clear connection between an action and or a data type and or a purpose for private information. These annotations will all fit into a privacy ontology which will be linked that has several categories and subcategories of actions data types and purposes. If there are not exact words found within the selection of text that indicate an action data type or purpose the annotator will state that that that label which exists in the ontology will take its place in the output. So the goal of the model will be to carefuly examine section of a privacy policy and identify those entities within the text which align to the actions data type and purposes found within the privacy ontology, and make the section be the extent to which all entitites within it are related to each other, but if any is not with any other than it will not be included within the selection. I will include the privacy ontology and several examples to look through an emulate. Notice that within the document there are sections of text within {#s /} these represent sections where entities are all correlated with each other. also notice the [#a ] actions, [#dt ] data types and [#p ] purposes in accordance to the privacy_ontology.json
