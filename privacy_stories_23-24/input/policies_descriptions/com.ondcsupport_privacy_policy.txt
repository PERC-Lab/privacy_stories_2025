Our Commitment
Open Network For Digital Commerce (“we”, “us”, “the website”, “ONDC”) is strongly committed to the data subject’s (“you”, “your”, “subscriber”, “user”) right to privacy and to keeping your information secure. To earn your trust and confidence in our commitment, we are fully disclosing our privacy practices. We encourage you to read our privacy statement to understand what types of personally identifiable information we collect and how we use this information. This statement applies solely to the information collected on ondc.org.
This Privacy Policy describes the usage of information provided or collected on the sites and applications where this Privacy Policy is posted. We follow this Privacy Policy in accordance with applicable law in the regions where we operate. In some cases, we may provide additional data Privacy Policies specific to certain services or regions. Those terms are to be read in combination with this policy.
When you provide information to us on a third-party site or platform (for example, via our applications like social media login) the information we collect is through those third-party sites linked with our applications and is covered by this Privacy Policy, and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy policy. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our site.

Your Controls and Choices
a. Managing Your Information
When you use the Services from ONDC (websites or any of its sub sites), we make all reasonable efforts to provide you, as and when requested by you, with access to your personal information and shall further ensure that any personal information or information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible, subject to any requirement for such personal information or information to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
To exercise rights applicable to you as a data subject, you may write to us at
teams@ondc.org
and raise a request for the specified right. Kindly ensure you use appropriate language in the subject line (e.g. Data Access Request, Data Portability Request, Data Deletion Request) while raising all such requests, to help us process your requests faster and more efficiently.
We provide you the ability to exercise certain controls and choices regarding our collection, use and sharing of your personal information. In accordance with applicable law, your controls and choices may include:
b. Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information
You can ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you (this is the information which you cannot update yourself within your ONDC account) by sending us an e-mail. You can access and update some of your personal information through your account settings. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date. The website may send you periodic reminders via email to maintain the accuracy of your personal information.
c. Data Retention and Erasure
We retain your personal information as long as necessary for the legitimate interests specified in this policy and for us to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your account. Please note that if your request the erasure of your personal information;
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations and reasons of public interests in the area of public health. For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the website, even after your account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
Because we maintain copies of personal information to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
d. Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing
For withdrawing your consent at any time during the tenure of your services with us, you may choose to do so by sending us an e-mail at
teams@ondc.org . We shall review your request and may ask you to verify your identity. After verification we will withdraw the consent for which request was made by you and stop any further processing of your personal information.
e. Objection to Processing
Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time, ask us to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an email to us. Please be aware that if you do not allow us to collect personal information from you, we may not be able to deliver certain experiences, products, and services to you, and some of our services may not be able to take account of your interests and preferences. If collection of personal information is mandatory, we will make that clear at the point of collection so that you can make an informed decision whether to participate. If you have questions about the specific personal information about you that we process or retain, and your rights regarding that personal information, please contact our customer support team.
Children’s Privacy
The website is not intentionally designed for or directed at persons younger than 18 years of age. ONDC does not knowingly permit any person who is under 18 years of age to register with the services or to provide any other personally identifying information. If ONDC becomes aware that any personally identifiable information of persons less than 18 years of age has been collected on the website without verified parental consent, then ONDC will take the appropriate steps to delete any such information and notify the parent.
However, we consider it the responsibility of parents to monitor their children’s use of our services. Nevertheless, it is our policy not to collect and process any personal information from children below 18 years of age or offer to send any promotional materials to persons in that category. ONDC does not seek or intend to seek or receive any personal information from children. Should a parent or guardian have reasons to believe that a minor has provided ONDC with personal information without their prior consent, please write at
teams@ondc.org
to ensure that the personal information is removed from the website.
Security and compliance with laws
We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. Some of the safeguards we may use to protect your information are firewalls and data encryption, and information access controls. If you know or have reason to believe that your account credentials have been lost, stolen, altered, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your account, please contact us by contacting our customer support team.
