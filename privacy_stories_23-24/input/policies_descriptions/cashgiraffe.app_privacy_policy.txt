This means that personal data includes, for example, email addresses, addresses, mobile phone numbers, user names, profile pictures, personal preferences and use behaviour regarding the apps used on your end device, user content, financial information and health-related information. However, this could also include one-time identifiers such as the IP address of your end device or the browser you use, and other specific information about your mobile device.
This Data Privacy Statement covers all personal data that is stored and processed by you when using Cash Giraffe.

We will use your data to perform and process the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe. Within this framework, we will use your data primarily for the calculation and payment of the bonuses acquired by you in the course of your use of Cash Giraffe and inform you about apps participating in Cash Giraffe. Other use will only take place due to other statutory obligations or authorisation, if you have granted us permission, or if the use is for legitimate interests of justDice GmbH as the provider of Cash Giraffe.
The legal basis for the processing of your data may be the following:
your consent to data use within the framework of Cash Giraffe in accordance with Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR;
he fulfilment of our service obligations resulting from the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe, in order to provide you with the desired services, in accordance with Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR;

of several mobile phone numbers (which are used to validate the identity of the user), and certain changes to the mobile operating systems, such as the granting of unrestricted admin access, installation of malware or a specific modification of the operating system etc.);
in order to guarantee the security of our services and ensure that our offering (apps and web server) is technically safe and works properly;
to secure and implement our contractual entitlements and claims.
Legal bases in accordance with Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR, if the collection, storage, transfer or other processing of the data is legally prescribed or necessary for the processing, in order to fulfil our statutory obligations.
What Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Data?
You have the right at any time to receive free information about the extent and content of the processing of your personal data by us. You also have the right to request from us the rectification, restriction of processing, or erasure of your personal data.
In the event of data privacy violations, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.
Further information can be found further down in this Data Privacy Statement, in the following section:
“Your Rights as a Data Subject” .
In particular, your personal data will be used as follows during the use of Cash Giraffe:
Registration
In order to use Cash Giraffe, you must register for Cash Giraffe.
Consent to the Processing of Personal Data for the Use of Cash Giraffe
When using Cash Giraffe for the first time, you first have to accept our terms and conditions of use (GTC) during the registration and agree to the processing of your personal data by Cash Giraffe. For this purpose, you have to confirm the following declaration of consent by clicking on the “ACCEPT” button underneath (if you do not want to give consent, please click on “REJECT”; the use of Cash Giraffe will then not be possible):
I hereby agree that by using Cash Giraffe may use the following personal data:
Registration data (email address, date of birth, gender)
Installed apps (including the use duration and use history)
The data is linked to your device via the device ID (GAID or IDFA) ransmitted to our servers in encrypted form. So that app providers can finance our app proposals, your device ID must be transferred to them for billing purposes. In order to measure the usage time as well as the installed apps, users can voluntarily upload screenshots from their mobile phone via the Cash Giraffe, after which they will be automatically processed, evaluated, and stored in our system for your membership.
The processing of the above data is required in order to be able to suggest apps available in the Cash Giraffe that match your interests, propose their installation via system notifications, and allow the bonuses earned from using said apps to be calculated. I am aware that the above data results in an interest profile, which, depending on the type of apps I use, may contain particularly sensitive personal data (such as health data or data on my sexual orientation as well as any other data from special categories defined in Art. 9 para. 1 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
If necessary,
a selfie is required
(only with bonus payment)
I understand that for reasons of fraud prevention, bonuses that I earn through the use of Cash Giraffe will only be possible after additional user verification via a selfie taken with my device's camera when I first request a bonus. My consent to the processing of my personal data therefore already applies to the processing of these photos. I acknowledge that selfies are also special-category personal data per Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR and expressly consent to the processing described below.
We use users' selfies exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that bonuses have not been earned through the automated, fraudulent use of software. For this purpose, a photo (“selfie”) is saved when your face is recorded using your device's camera. We use the recording to create an individual and anonymous digital user ID (in the form of a hash value) that is not linked to your account and is used to check whether the bonus has actually been earned by a real person and whether this person has already requested or received a bonus with another account. For reasons of data economy, this is only necessary if you want to receive bonuses. If you do not want to receive bonuses, you can use Cash Giraffe fully without providing any selfies. The selfies will not be used by us for any other purposes and we will delete them 4 weeks after your bonus has been disbursed.
Information about Withdrawing Consent
The withdrawal of your consent and the termination of the use of Cash Giraffe is possible at any time with future effect, and can be sent to justDice GmbH via email at contact@appstation.online or by post to justDice GmbH, An der Alster 42, 20099 Hamburg. Special fees (beyond the regular transmission fees of your telephone or internet service provider, or letter postage) do not apply for the withdrawal of consent. If you withdraw your consent, your data will be deleted from the Cash Giraffe database; if deletion is not possible, the processing of your data will be restricted instead of its being deleted. Further use by Cash Giraffe is no longer possible after the withdrawal of your consent.

Registration/Setting Up a User Account
To be able to use all functions of Cash Giraffe and in particular to benefit from the bonus payments, you have to register for the use of Cash Giraffe by setting up a user account. The registration therefore serves to provide the services of Cash Giraffe and calculate the bonuses generated by you.
During the registration process, we will collect and store certain other personal data about you for the setting up of a customer account, if necessary. This includes (if we have not already collected and stored this in accordance with the steps described above, see above) the following information:
Payment data : Email address of a PayPal account or details for other payment providers that are supported by Cash Giraffe.
Selfies : For reasons of fraud prevention, bonuses that users earn through the use of Cash Giraffe will only be possible after additional user verification via a selfie taken with their device's camera when they first request a bonus. We use users' selfies exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that bonuses have not been earned through the automated, fraudulent use of software. For this purpose, a photo (“selfie”) is saved when your face is recorded using your device's camera. We use the recording to create an individual and anonymous digital user ID (in the form of a hash value) that is not linked to your account and is used to check whether the bonus has actually been earned by a real person and whether this person has already requested or received a bonus with another account. We will not use the selfies for any other purpose. For reasons of data economy, this is only necessary if you want to receive bonuses. If you do not want to receive bonuses, you can use Cash Giraffe fully without providing any selfies.
This data is processed on the basis of the consent you have given (see above) and is used to fulfil the contract for you to use Cash Giraffe.
If you do not provide this information or data, you may not be able to use Cash Giraffe at all or only to a limited extent and will, in particular, not be eligible for any bonus payments.
Use Data
During the use of Cash Giraffe, we log and store certain data automatically.
Data Processing for the Recommendation of New Apps
To be able to recommend to you other apps that participate in Cash Giraffe based on your current app preferences, a list of apps currently installed on your end device, as well as apps that you have already installed (but that you have deinstalled) in the operating system installed on your end device, including a use history of all these apps, will be sent to us during the installation of Cash Giraffe.
In order to know your long-term preferences and continue to offer you interesting apps, after the installation of Cash Giraffe and permanently during the use of Cash Giraffe, other apps installed by you on your end device will be automatically recognised by Cash Giraffe and the name of each newly installed app will be sent to us.
In addition, we will log data about the use of the apps running in the foreground of your end device and the temporal extent of the use (date, time and duration of the use of all apps).
For the logging of the use data within Cash Giraffe, we measure the so-called “customer journey”. For this purpose, each click or typing of a key within Cash Giraffe will be logged and linked to your profile or stored on the server.
The processing of this data takes place based on the consent granted by you (see above) and serves to perform the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe by you.
Data Processing for the Calculation of Bonus Payments
We also use the data about your use of the apps running in the foreground of your end device to calculate the bonuses generated by you, if you have obtained and installed these apps via Cash Giraffe. For this purpose, we also log and use data about your purchases of services and virtual items within the framework of the apps used by you (in-app purchases), and about relevant in-app occurrences relevant for the calculation of the bonuses, such as level increases.
The processing of this data takes place based on the consent granted by you (see above) and serves to perform the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe by you.
Use Data about the End Device Used by You
In order to be able to identify you beyond any doubt during the use of Cash Giraffe and allocate you for the purpose of the recommendation of new apps, and the calculation and payment of the bonus payments, we store other data about the use of Cash Giraffe and the end device used by you for this purpose. This includes the so-called Google Advertiser ID (“GAID” for Android) and the so-called Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA” for Apple iOS), the Widevine ID, the model and product name of your end device, the version of the operating system, the browser type used and its display resolution, as well as the IP address allocated to your end device and information about when which content from our offering was accessed, the names of the files requested, and their dates and times of access. We require this data to determine the content requested by you (e.g. text, images, games and product information as well as files provided for download etc.), in order to enable the offering of our services in accordance with the terms and conditions of use, and for the optimal display of Cash Giraffe on your end device. In order for app providers to finance our app suggestions, they must be sent the device ID for billing purposes.
The processing of this data takes place based on the consent granted by you (see above) and serves to perform the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe by you.
If our server logs also automatically log your IP address, this will take place solely for the purpose of guaranteeing the security of our systems, or for fraud prevention, and the IP address will be automatically erased after 30 days at the latest.
The processing of this data therefore takes place to safeguard legitimate interests of justDice GmbH as the provider of Cash Giraffe.
Anonymised Use Data to Improve Our Services
Otherwise, the above-mentioned use data will be prepared, and we will process it in a general and anonymised manner in order to generally analyse the use of Cash Giraffe. This data includes the models and product names of the end devices employed for the use of Cash Giraffe, the version of the operating system, the browser types used and their display resolutions, as well as general details about when which content from our offering is accessed, the names of the files requested or which data is accessed most frequently, and their dates and times of access. This data is solely for the needs-based design of Cash Giraffe and therefore to constantly improve our services, and detect and rectify any security flaws.
This data does not enable matches to be made to you personally.
The processing of this data will take place to safeguard legitimate interests of justDice GmbH as the provider of Cash Giraffe.
Note: Authorisation to Access Functions and Data on the End Device
In order to be able to use all functions of Cash Giraffe, you may have to grant Cash Giraffe permission to access certain functions and data on your device (such as access to your camera or your app library), but this depends on your device and the operating system, over which we have no influence. We will use all authorisation granted by you solely for the above-named purposes, even if authorisation granted (e.g. for technical reasons) theoretically enables other possible uses. You can normally (in other words, depending on your device and the installed operating system) cancel granted authorisation in your device settings at any time.
Contact Section
In the contact section of the app, you can contact us via email using our contact form. Your email address will thereby be collected by us. You can decide yourself which data you provide to us within the framework of the contact.
In this case, we will only use your data to respond to your query.
The processing of this data takes place based on your permission and to safeguard legitimate interests of justDice GmbH as the provider of Cash Giraffe.
Storage Duration of Your Data
We will only store your personal data for as long as we need it for the performance of the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe, for the fulfilment of your wishes, or for our legitimate interests for the purposes of which we have logged your personal data, or for as long as is permitted or required by law:
For as long as you take part in the use of Cash Giraffe, we will store and process your personal data for the duration of your use of Cash Giraffe, until you end it or request that we erase your data;
For as long as you set up a user account for our services, we will store and process your personal data for the duration of your use of Cash Giraffe, until you terminate it or until you request that we erase your data. The selfies we use for user verification will not be used by us for any other purposes and we will delete them 4 weeks after your bonus has been disbursed;
If you have agreed to the use of your email address for marketing purposes, we will store your email address within our mailing database until you deregister or request that we erase the data, or by the end of a period of inactivity (no interaction with us for a maximum duration of 18 months);
If you send us a query, we will process your personal data for the duration of the processing of your query.
When we no longer require your personal data, we will erase it from our systems and records, or anonymise it so that it can no longer be identified.
We can retain certain personal data in order to comply with our statutory and regulatory obligations, and to enable us to manage our rights (e.g. the assertion of our rights in court), or for statistical purposes.
Forwarding of Data
The passing on of your personal data without your explicit prior permission will only take place in the following cases, in addition to the other cases named in this Data Privacy Statement:
If necessary for the resolution of unlawful use or misuse of Cash Giraffe or for prosecution, personal data will be passed on to the criminal prosecution authorities and, if necessary, to third parties who have been harmed. However, this will only take place if there are specific indications of unlawful conduct or misuse. We are also legally obliged to provide information to certain public bodies upon request. These are criminal prosecution authorities, authorities that pursue administrative offences punishable by a financial penalty, and the financial authorities.
The forwarding to third parties bound to professional secrecy can only take place if this is necessary for the implementation of the Cash Giraffe terms and conditions of use or other agreements, and our claims from the contract on the use of Cash Giraffe.
For the provision of our service, we are occasionally reliant on contractually bound third-party companies and external service providers, e.g. for our customer service and the hosting of Cash Giraffe. In such cases, information will be passed on to these companies or individual people in order to enable further processing. These external service providers are carefully selected by us and checked regularly, to ensure that your privacy remains protected, and they may only process the data for the purposes specified by us. They are also contractually obliged by us to only handle your data exclusively in accordance with this Data Privacy Statement and the German data privacy laws.
As part of the further development of our business, the structure of our company may change, in that the legal form is changed, or subsidiary companies, business units or components are founded, purchased or sold. In the event of such transactions, the customer information will be passed on, together with the part of the company to be transferred, with your consent. During any transfer of personal data to third parties to the specified extent, we will ensure that the further use takes place in accordance with this Data Privacy Statement and the relevant data protection laws, and we will ask for your permission.
Security Measures to Protect the Data Stored by Us
We are obliged to protect your privacy and treat your personal data confidentially. Your data will be stored in our databases, which are only accessible to us and employees specifically trained in data protection.
If we use support from third-party service providers who process your data on our behalf in order to provide our web services, we have ensured that they are subject to the strict conditions of this Data Privacy Statement, and that the use of your data beyond the cases described in this Data Privacy Statement will not take place. All contractors, service providers and their employees are subject extensively to our instructions and are also in particular legally obliged to observe, and trained in, the protection of your data.
In order to prevent the loss or misuse of the data stored by us, we take comprehensive technical and organisational safety precautions, which are regularly reviewed and adjusted to meet technological advances. If it is within our sphere of influence, we use in particular modern encryption techniques as well as a variety of other measures to prevent third parties from obtaining unauthorised information.
However, we would like to point out to you that due to the structure of the internet, it is possible that the data protection regulations and the above-named security measures of other persons or institutions not within our area of responsibility cannot be observed. In particular, data passed on in a non-encrypted form can be read by third parties, even if it is sent via email. We have no technical influence on this occurrence. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the user to protect the data it provides against misuse, by encryption or other methods.
Data Storage Abroad
We consistently ensure the strict data protection made legally binding in the European Union. In some cases, particularly for technical reasons, it may transpire that your data entrusted to us is stored on servers outside of your country (even outside of the European Union) in which you originally entered your data. In this case and in the case of a risk that countries to which your data are sent are not subject to data protection law that is just as strict as that in your home country and in the country from which you use our services, we ensure that your data is handled in accordance with the provisions of this Data Privacy Statement.
Data processing by processor
For the operation of our services we are partly dependent on third party suppliers (called processors). For these companies to be able to carry out their services, your data must be transferred to them. We have entered into a processing contract with these contract processors in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR and they implement the strict requirements of the data protection authorities when using your data. We ensure that all third party service providers, who assist us in the provision of our services, comply with data protection law by this agreement and strict controls that your data will be treated according to our instructions and will not be disclosed to third parties. In addition, we take further measures to guarantee the protection and safety of your data. Data will only be processed outside the EEA if the service provider guarantees that we comply with the requirements of European data protection law.
The following service providers (processors) work with us for the following purposes:
Amazon Web Services, Inc., P.O. BOX 81226, Seattle, WA 98108-1226, USA
