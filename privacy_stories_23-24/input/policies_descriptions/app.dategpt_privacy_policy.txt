We also track content you visit on the Services and duration on specific pages of the Services to help us improve your access to the Services and enhance our Services. Cookies also enable us to track your general location and similar information that typically remains in aggregate form and does not identify you individually. If such information does identify you, we will treat it as personal information subject to this Privacy Policy. We may also use cookies or pixels to collect data with respect to confirmation that a message has been delivered to you, confirmation that you have read a message, and related information about our digital communications.

The information generated by this tool (including IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google in aggregate form and used to evaluate use of the Services, compile reports on Services activity and other services relating to Services usage.

Location Information. We or our service providers may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources.  For example, we may use your IP address to identify your general location or we may receive more precise location data from your mobile device (such as via GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points).  If you have enabled location information sharing while using the Apps actively, then your location information may be shared with our service provider in order to help you locate other users near you.  We may use location data to analyze certain information, and to improve our Apps and Services and relevance of the information we provide to you via the Apps and Services.  Please note that if you do not share your location information certain features of the Apps and Services will have very limited functionality.
How will we use your information?
In general, we use your personal information to accomplish our business and commercial purposes, including for marketing, and transactional purposes, or to otherwise enhance our business practices and our services to you. More specifically, we may use your personal information:

When you supply any personal information, such as an e-mail address or phone number it may be shared with a service provider who has been hired by us to provide services to help us with our business activities such as product fulfillment, hosting, and follow-up information. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of assets, reorganization or liquidation of our business. Your personal information can be shared freely by us across platforms owned by us. For example, information collected through WhosHere can be shared with WhosHere Plus, NticeMe, and DateGPT and vice versa.

Each of our Apps includes a function which allows you to delete your account within the App.  If you elect to cancel your account at any time, you may choose the account deletion function within the App, in which event we will delete your account information (including phone number, profile information and account history) held in our production systems. (Some portions of your account data may be retained in our static archives, but no such archived information will be further used.)   If you require assistance with that process, to cancel or delete your account you should contact us with your request at
help@dategpt.app . When requesting assistance, please provide the phone number to which your account relates.
Please be aware that, following deletion of your account, you will need to create a new account if ever you wish to use the Apps again.

You can choose whether or not to allow the Apps to collect and use real-time information about your device’s location through your device’s settings.  You can manage these preferences when the App is first launched or at a later stage by using the setting on your mobile device.  If you block the use of location information, some functionality on the App will be inaccessible and will not function properly.

Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-party websites or applications.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage, nor does it apply to your relationship with the third party websites, applications, services, and surveys that may be linked to, facilitated through or provided via our Services. This Privacy Policy only applies to information we collect from you while you are using the Services. If you navigate to a third-party website or application from the Services, we strongly encourage you to review and become familiar with that third-party website’s or mobile application’s own privacy policy and statements.
Security
We use reasonable precautions including technical, administrative, and physical procedures, to protect personal information from loss, misuse, or alteration.  Although guaranteed security does not exist on the Internet or offline, we make commercially reasonable efforts to handle such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.  Due to the design of the Internet and other factors outside our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Any information, including personal information, you provide to us via the Internet is at your own risk. If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can contact us at
help@dategpt.app .
