California Privacy Rights
This Section applies to the use of the Site by Users located in the State of California. This section documents compliance with applicable California state laws that may apply to Users of the Site in California, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, California Civil Code §§ 1798.100 et seq. (“CCPA”), California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 (“CalOPPA”), California Assembly Bill 1584 (“AB 1584”), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) – AB 375. Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act California Civil Code §§ 1798.100 et seq. (“CCPA”) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes User CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. The CCPA can be reviewed at oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa. In this section “User” or “Users” refers to California residents. Under the CCPA Company is required to disclose categories of sources from which LA Auto Show® collects Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we share such information. We are also required to communicate information about rights Users have under California law, such as:
Right to access Personal Information. [CC § 1798.100] Users may be entitled to receive the specific pieces of User Personal Information we hold.
Right to data portability. [CC § 1798.100] Users may be entitled to receive a copy of User electronic Personal Information in a readily usable format.
Right to disclosure. [CC §§1798.110, 1798.115] Users may be entitled to receive information regarding the categories of Personal Information we collected, the sources from which we collected Personal Information, the purposes for which we collected and shared Personal Information, the categories of Personal Information that we sold, the categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold, and the categories of Personal Information that we disclosed for a business purpose in the 12 months preceding the User request. In the 12 months preceding July 21, 2022, we did not disclose to any third party any categories of User Personal Information for business purposes or otherwise, including without limitation: identifiers, commercial information, electronic network and Internet activity information, geolocation data, or inferences about Users drawn from such data.
Right to deletion. [CC § 1798.105] Users may be entitled to request that we delete the Personal Information that we have collected from User. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor User requests in compliance with applicable laws. Please note, however, we may need or be required to keep such information, such as for our legitimate business purposes or to comply with applicable law.
Right to opt-out of certain sharing with third parties. [CC § 1798.120] Users are entitled to direct us to stop disclosing User Personal Information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. We do not currently disclose any User Personal Information to any third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. If we ever do disclose any User Personal Information to third parties, Users can exercise such right to opt-out by clicking on the link on our homepage titled “Do Not Sell My Personal Information,” which will direct Users to an Internet page that enables Users, or a person authorized by the User, to opt-out of the sale of the User’s Personal Information. Users between the ages of 13 and 16 must affirmatively authorize the sale or disclosure of any User Personal Information. For Users under the age of 13, a parent or legal guardian must affirmatively authorize any such disclosure. We do not require a User or consumer to create an account in order to direct us not to sell the User’s/consumer’s Personal Information. User/consumers can also opt-out by sending an email to our webmaster at Social@laautoshow.com, sending a written, postpaid request addressed to: ANSA Productions, Inc., 801 South Grand Ave., Suite 375, Los Angeles, California 90017 United States.
We will never monetize User Personal Information by providing it to a third party in exchange for money. The CCPA has a broader definition of the term “sell” which includes disclosing Personal Information to any third party for valuable consideration. We do not share any Personal Information with any of our advertising partners, nor do we disclose any cookie data to any third parties.
In addition, we are required to provide User certain information about the business and commercial purposes for which we collect and share User Personal Information. We may use or disclose User Personal Information we collect for the business purposes described in this policy, including but not limited to: processing payments, conducting research, detecting security incidents, preventing fraud, debugging and repairing errors, maintaining User account, providing customer service, and other activities to improve our service, market our services, and to understand how Users interact with our services.
Right to Non-Discrimination. [CC § 1798.125] Company fully supports User privacy rights and will not discriminate against Users for exercising any of User CCPA rights. If you exercise any of the rights provided under the CCPA, we shall refrain from the following activities: Denying goods or services to you; charging different prices for goods or services; providing a different quality of the good or service; or relaying to the consumer that she will receive a different price or quality of the good or service.

Privacy Portal
Only a User or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that User has authorized to act on User’s behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to User Personal Information. Users may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of User’s child.
Users may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must: i) Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify User is the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative of User; and ii) describe User’s request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to User requests or provide Users with Personal Information if we cannot verify User’s identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to User. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require Users to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
