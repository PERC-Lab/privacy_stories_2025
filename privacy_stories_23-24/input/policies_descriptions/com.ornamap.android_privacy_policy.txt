ORNAMAP'S PRIVACY POLICY
Updated: 7th September 2023
Effective as of September 7th, 2023, this privacy policy outlines
our data collection practices, the reasons behind them, and how we
utilize the information. It pertains to all individuals who utilize
our application, known as "OrnaMap."
We are ORNAMAP TECHNOLOGIES, identified as "we," "our," or "us," and
we are a registered business in Nigeria, holding BN Number 7088839
with the Nigeria Corporate Affairs Commission. Should you have any
inquiries regarding this policy, please reach out to us via the App
or send an email to
support@ornamap.com
What data do we retain and for what purpose?
We process three categories of information: (1) information
provided by you, (2) data generated as you interact with the App,
and (3) information obtained from external sources.
1. Information You Provide
When you utilize our App, you have the opportunity to supply
us with two types of information: (a) details regarding your
places and preferences, and (b) direct communications.
(a) Details regarding your places and preferences
You can choose to share information about your preferred
locations, such as Home, Work, and other travel preferences.
We utilize this data to enhance personalized
journey-planning services and also analyze it collectively
to improve the App. For example, we may prioritize certain
journey results over others based on this data.
(b) Direct communications
When you engage in communication with us, such as reporting
problems or raising queries, we may receive information
about the type of device you are using during the
interaction. This information is instrumental in addressing
issues within the App.
2. Information Created When You Use Our App
The following outlines the types of information that are
generated when you use our App. We associate this information
with a randomly generated installation ID number, which
changes each time you install the OrnaMap App. This
installation ID is used to pseudonymize the data we collect
from you, and we do not access any permanent device ID
numbers.
(a) Location Information
We employ the location data described in the "Location
Information" section to enhance the App's results and for
the purposes detailed below. If you have enabled your
device's location services as an OrnaMap App user, we may
collect and utilize your starting location information when
you launch the App. If you disable location services on your
device, we will only collect the starting and ending points
you manually search for.
(b) Device Informatio
We gather information about the devices you use to access
our App, including the type of computer or device, the App's
installation ID on your device, hardware model, operating
system and versions, software, file names and versions,
preferred language, time zone settings, and device motion
data. This information is essential for diagnosing bugs and
enhancing the App. Importantly, we do not collect any
permanent device ID numbers.
(c) Log and Usage Information
Upon your initial use of the app, we collect your location,
and during subsequent interactions, we gather data on how
and when you use it. This includes details such as the
journey results you select, pages visited, instances of app
crashes, and other system activity. We utilize this
information to improve our App in various ways, including
bug fixes, crash prevention, and determining which features
our users find most valuable.
A Summary of How Your Information Is Utilized
In summary, the information we gather serves the following
purposes:
1. Providing and Enhancing Our App:

be updated to reflect any changes in our data usage practices.
what third parties receive your information?
Occasionally, we may share information with third parties to
enhance the App and improve the user experience. We make every
effort to pseudonymize the data (remove personally identifiable
information) and minimize the information sent to these third
parties.
1. Search Partners:
We collaborate with search partners such as Google to help you
discover desired destinations within the App. These partners
receive the names of the places you search for, and if you have
enabled location services on your device, they also receive your
current location. This is done to provide you with the most
relevant search results.
2. Analytics Vendors:
We employ third-party vendors like Google Analytics to gain
insights into user interactions within the App. These vendors
receive information indicating that someone has interacted with
specific features in the App. They organize and provide this
data to us to aid in making enhancements to the App.
Importantly, this information does not contain personally
identifiable details.
3. Crash/Error Reporting Vendors:
For reporting and addressing crashes experienced while using the
App, we utilize Crashlytics. This helps us identify and rectify
issues with the App to ensure a smoother experience for you.
On What Legal Grounds Do We Process Your Information?
We will only handle your personal information when we have a
lawful justification to do so. Our legal grounds for processing
your personal data encompass the following:
1. Legitimate Interests:
We may process your data when it is necessary to serve our
legitimate interests, which include activities such as
researching, developing, enhancing, and delivering new and
personalized features for the App. Additionally, we use this
basis to provide support to users during their trips and to
ensure the security of the App for all users. Furthermore, it
allows us to take measures to prevent violations of our terms
and policies, as well as to prevent harmful or illegal
activities.
2. Legal and Regulatory Compliance:
We may process your data when it is essential to adhere to
applicable legal and regulatory obligations. This ensures that
our data processing activities align with the requirements set
forth by relevant laws and regulations.

You have the legal right to request access to a copy of the
personal information we have on record for you. To do so, please
contact us at
support@ornamap.com . To provide you with your information, it's necessary for you
to have created an account, as this enables us to link your
Installation ID to a verifiable email address. You should have
access to the email address associated with your account so that
we can confirm your identity.
Deletion:
We retain your personal information for as long as it's required
to provide our services and products. You possess the right to
request the deletion of your personal information under certain
circumstances. These circumstances may include when you believe
we no longer need the data for its original purposes, you wish
to withdraw your consent (provided there is no other lawful
basis for data use), or if we are not using your information in
a lawful manner. Please note that for legal reasons, we may not
always be able to fulfill deletion requests. You can initiate a
request for the deletion of your personal information by
emailing us at
support@ornamap.com .
Notifications:
We may send you information that we believe could be of interest
to you (e.g., notifications about train and ferry disruptions
relevant to your location), or information you've specifically
requested from us via push notifications and/or email (if
provided). If you prefer not to receive further notifications or
emails, you have the option to opt-out.
Our Measures to Ensure the Security of Your Information
We prioritize the security of all user-associated information. To
safeguard this data, we implement various protective measures,
including encryption, access controls for information, and
firewalls.
However, it's important to be aware that transmitting information
over the internet and mobile networks is never entirely foolproof.
We cannot provide an absolute guarantee of the security of data
you submit through the App while it is in transit over the
internet or mobile networks. Therefore, any such data submission
carries an inherent level of risk and is undertaken at your
discretion.
The Duration for Which We Retain Your Information
Through the provision of products or services, we generate records
that encompass your information, including customer account
records and activity records. We diligently maintain these records
to facilitate our ability to serve our users effectively and to
adhere to legal and regulatory obligations. These records are
invaluable in demonstrating our commitment to fulfilling our
responsibilities and in providing evidence of our business
activities.
The duration for which we retain records is contingent on factors
such as the type of record, the characteristics of the associated
activity, product, or service, as well as the pertinent legal and
regulatory prerequisites. The duration of information retention
may be subject to change based on evolving business needs or
modifications to legal and regulatory requirements.
Which locations are your personal information stored
The information you provide through the App is transmitted to and
securely stored on servers located in both Ireland and the United
States. It's important to note that information you submit may
also be transferred by us to our other offices and/or shared with
third parties as described in the aforementioned situations. These
third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area,
including locations such as the United States.
do you collect children's information?
We do not intentionally gather personal information from
individuals under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old,
kindly refrain from submitting any personal information through
the App or email. We encourage parents and legal guardians to
supervise their children's internet activities and to support the
enforcement of our privacy policy by advising their children not
to disclose personal information on our website without their
consent. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age
of 13 has furnished personal information to us, please get in
touch with us using the contact details provided below, and we
will take the necessary steps to remove that information from our
databases.
How Will You Be Informed of Revisions to Our Privacy Policy?
We may periodically update this privacy policy. Any modifications
or additions to this privacy policy will be made available within
the App and become effective on the date of their posting. We
encourage you to periodically review this privacy notice to
ascertain whether any changes have been made to how we handle your
personal data. The most recent update to this privacy policy was
implemented on September 7, 2023.
