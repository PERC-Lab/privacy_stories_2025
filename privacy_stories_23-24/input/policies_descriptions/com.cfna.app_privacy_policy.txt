Privacy and Use of This Website
Privacy & Legal
Privacy and Use of This Website
Rev. 10/2021
1. Use
Use of this website (the "Site") constitutes your consent to the collection and use of the
information as described in this Privacy Policy as modified from time to time by CFNA.
2. Registration
To use this Site, or certain portions or features of this Site, you may be required to first complete an
online registration form. During registration you may be prompted to provide to CFNA with certain personal
information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and account
information. Becoming a registered user enables you to review confidential account information for the
service(s) for which you are enrolled and perform other confidential transactions.
3. Browsing
If you browse this Site and have not registered, you are browsing anonymously. Personally identifiable
information such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address is not collected as you browse.
However, your use of this Site may be tracked, regardless of whether or not you have registered.
4. Cookies
One way your use of this Site is tracked is by using "Cookies" which are small pieces of
information that are stored by your Internet browser on your hard drive. A Cookie cannot retrieve any other
data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address or any other personally
identifiable information. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to this Site and provide you
with a customized experience that we feel will be of value to you. Most web browsers allow you to exercise
control over Cookie files on your computer by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file
is stored. Please take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this function. If you do elect
to disable this Site's Cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of this Site.
Accepting Cookies is required if you want to view personal or confidential information online,
because they are essential for site administration and security.
5. Log Files
This Site automatically collects information pertaining to your access. Such information may include your
Internet protocol ("IP") address as well as other connection and usage information for system
administration and troubleshooting purposes. (An IP address indicates the location of your computer on the
Internet.) CFNA does not link an IP address to any personally identifiable information.
6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 1, 2010, and updates and replaces any previous Privacy Policy
for this Site. If we decide to change or update this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy
on this Site so that you will always be aware of what information we collect, use and distribute. Changes
are effective when posted on this Site. You should review this Privacy Policy from time to time to be aware
of any such changes. Your continued use of this Site indicates your agreement to any such changes. If you
have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please use the "Contact Us" section of this Site.
7. Childrens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
This Site is a website directed to the general public. CFNA does not knowingly collect, maintain or use
personal information from children under 13.
8. E-mail
We may use your e-mail address to send you the following types of e-mail messages:
Occasional updates about our products and services as well as CFNA marketing offers.
Regularly scheduled e-mail newsletters related to CFNA products or services for which you have enrolled.
Valuable offers from our business partners that we send you on their behalf.
Service notifications related to your account(s).
All e-mail offers and e-mail newsletters sent to you by CFNA provide instructions on how to opt out of
receiving future offers or newsletters. These instructions are located at the bottom of the e-mail message.
You may receive separate newsletters pertaining to different CFNA products and services. In that case, you
must reply to and decline the newsletters individually. If you opt out, we will still send you e-mail with
service updates as well as other important information related to CFNA online products or services for which
you are enrolled.
9. Transfer of Database
Please note that because a customer information database is customarily considered a business asset, CFNA
reserves the right to transfer the database in a merger or sale of some or all of its assets or in an action
for bankruptcy. Your information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy by the
acquiring or merged company unless you are notified and provided an opportunity to change your preferences.
10. Data Security
This Site incorporates various physical, electronic and administrative procedures to safeguard the
confidentiality of your personal information. Access to your personal information is restricted. Only
employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your
personal information.
11. User Name and Password
Many areas of this Site require that you log in with the use of a User Name and Password as an additional
security measure that helps protect your confidential information. This allows CFNA to verify who you are
thereby allowing you access to your account information and preventing unauthorized access.
When you have finished using a secure area of this Site, you should always click on the "Log Out"
link that appears on each secure page. By logging out you will end your secure session. No further secure
transactions can be conducted without re-entering your User Name and Password.
12. Caching
You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that
some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your
"Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the
security of your confidential User Name or Password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your
account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of
anyone else viewing your confidential information.
13. Linked Sites and Framed Pages
THIS SITE MAY INCLUDE LINKS TO THE WEB SITES OF THIRD PARTIES ("LINKED SITES"). THIS SITE ALSO
INCLUDES CERTAIN PAGES THAT ARE FRAMED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FROM WEB SITES OF THIRD PARTIES ("FRAMED
PAGES"). CFNA PROVIDES LINKED SITES AND FRAMED PAGES AS A CONVENIENCE TO THE VISITORS TO THIS SITE. THE
INCLUSION OF ANY LINKED SITE OR FRAMED PAGE DOES NOT IMPLY CFNA'S ENDORSEMENT OF ANY COMPANY, ITS WEB
SITE, OR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IT SELLS. PLEASE NOTE THAT CFNA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONTENT, TERMS
OF USE OR THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF ANY WEB SITE OTHER THAN OUR OWN SITE AND THE TERMS AND POLICIES OF THE
PAGE OWNER WILL CONTROL. CFNA HAS NO DISCRETION TO ALTER, UPDATE, OR CONTROL THE CONTENT ON A LINKED SITE OR
FRAMED PAGE. THERE ARE INHERENT RISKS IN RELYING UPON USING, OR RETRIEVING ANY INFORMATION FOUND ON THE
INTERNET, AND CFNA URGES YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THESE RISKS BEFORE RELYING UPON, USING, OR
RETRIEVING ANY SUCH INFORMATION ON A LINKED SITE OR FRAMED PAGE.
14. Advertising
CFNA may use third party companies to serve ads on this Site. These companies help CFNA execute, optimize,
and measure the effectiveness of our online advertising programs. These companies use Cookies and
non-personally identifiable information (for example, information that does not include name, address,
e-mail address or telephone number) about your visit to this Site to measure advertising effectiveness and
to provide ads about goods and services that may interest you. CFNA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONTENT,
TERMS OF USE OR THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF THE ADVERTISEMENTS OR THE WEBSITES TO WHICH THEY LINK.
This Site's online advertisements and online applications may contain small graphics with tags in them.
These tags are not personally identifiable and work in conjunction with Cookies. These tags allow CFNA to
measure the effectiveness and response rates of our advertising.
