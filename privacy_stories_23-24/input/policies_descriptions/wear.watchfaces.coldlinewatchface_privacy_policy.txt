Information Collection & Share We do not collect or share any information. Complication data in a watch face such as battery level status, step count, weather, calendar, heart rate and other fitness data received from complication data providers. Watch faces receive data from complication data providers, which allows them to include complications without needing code for getting the underlying data. Watch faces retain control over how the data is rendered, so they can integrate data naturally with their design. Changes to This Privacy Policy We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.
