Deltek Privacy Policy
Effective Date: February 28, 2023
Deltek’s Privacy Practices – A Summary
Here at Deltek, we strive to deliver software and information solutions that connect and automate your projects to help you fuel your business.  As part of this mission, we want to be good stewards of the personal information you entrust to us as you interact with us, visit our websites, and use our services or applications.  This summary of our Privacy Policy explains the scope of our Policy, who we collect personal information from, what we collect, why, who it gets disclosed to, and the rights you may have over the personal information you entrust to us.  The full Policy is always available for your review but hopefully this summary will allow you to not only understand your rights but quickly get back to managing your projects and growing your business.
What Is Not Covered by This Privacy Policy?
When discussing how Deltek handles personal information, we want to first clarify what this Policy does not address. When you use our products or services (whether as our customer or as the end user of one of our customers), you may choose to upload, enter, or add data to our products or services for your own business purposes.  We call this “ Customer-Entered Data .” While Customer-Entered Data may include personal information, this data is controlled by our customers, not Deltek. As such, this Privacy Policy does not cover Customer-Entered Data. The privacy protections that cover Deltek’s handling of Customer-Entered Data are addressed under separate agreements with Deltek’s customers.
Who Do We Collect Personal Information From?
We collect personal information from visitors to our websites, our customers, end users of our products and services, third parties, and people who attend events (both virtual and in-person) that are offered by Deltek.
What Do We Collect?
We may collect personal information (sometimes called personal data) such as contact information (names, email addresses, phone numbers), commercial information (products or services purchased, obtained, or considered), network activity information (IP address, logging information, product usage), audio information (phone calls with customer support), professional information (your current role or job history), and geolocation information.  For a complete list of the types of personal information we have collected in the last 12 months, see “ How We Collect Information ” and the “ California Addendum ” below.
Why Do We Collect It?
We may use the personal information for a variety of purposes including to: help you use or to improve our Sites and Services; provide you with customer support; communicate with you; fulfill a contract with you; enforce our legal rights and obligations; and inform you of offerings or products from Deltek or our Partner Network.
Who Do We Disclose Information To?
We may disclose or transfer your personal information to our service providers (e.g., those who provide services on our behalf such as information technology and related infrastructure, analytics, and auditing); other Deltek entities; third party members of our Deltek Partner Network; as needed to comply with law; as part of a future corporate restructuring; or as directed by you or with your consent.
How Can You Control Your Personal Information?
You have several rights with respect to your personal information, including to unsubscribe from all marketing communications from Deltek; to correct, to delete, or request access to your personal information; and to prevent the sale or certain sharing of your personal information. Information on how to exercise these rights (as well as exceptions that may apply) are below.  If you have any questions about these rights or Deltek’s privacy practices, please reach out using one of the means listed in the “ Contact Us ” section below.

California Addendum – California Consumer Privacy Policy
California’s privacy laws recently expanded to define “consumer” to include individuals acting in a commercial or employment capacity.  In other words, the word “consumer” under these statutes captures not only traditional consumers but also individuals who may interact with a business as an employee or business partner.  If you are a California consumer, the following provisions apply to our processing of information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you or your household (“ California Personal Information” ). For California consumers, the provisions of this California Addendum prevail over any conflicting provisions in other sections of this Privacy Policy.

We have collected the following categories of California Personal Information within the last 12 months from the sources listed below:
(a) Identifiers, such as a real name, physical address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, or other similar identifiers. This category of information is collected from you, your devices, and third parties as described above in “ How We Collect Information ”.
(b) Personal information described in subdivision (e) of Section 1798.80 (California customer records statute), such as a name, address, telephone number, credit card number, debit card number, or other payment information. This category of information is collected from you, your devices, or other third parties such as our business partners.
(c) Commercial information, including products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies. This category of information is collected from you, your devices, or other third parties such as our business partners.
(d) Internet or other similar network activity, including, but not limited to, browsing history, search history, browser settings like language preference, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with a website, application, or advertisement. This category of information is collected from you and your devices.
(e) Geolocation data. This category of information is collected from you and your devices.
(f) Sensory data, including electronic, visual, or similar information. This category of information, such as photos or recordings of phone calls with Deltek personnel, is collected from you and third parties such as our business partners.
(g) Inferences, such as a profile about a consumer’s preferences, characteristics, and behavior, drawn from information we collect and insights we receive from third parties such as our marketing and advertising partners and data analytics providers.
(h) Sensitive personal information, such as account login information allowing access to an account, race, and ethnicity, in each case as further described above in the relevant categories. Additionally, as part of onboarding customers or hiring employees, we may also collect FEIN or SSN for legal compliance. Please note we do not collect sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you.
For more information on the types of information we have collected, how we have collected it, our uses, and how we have disclosed it for the past 12 months, please see the “ How We Collect Information ”, “ How We Use Information ”, and “ How We Disclose Information ” sections above. We retain each category of California Personal Information as described in the “ Retention ” Section of the Privacy Policy. We may also use the information we collect for our own or our service providers’ other operational purposes, purposes for which we provide you additional notice, or for purposes compatible with the context in which the California Personal Information was collected.
