Collection of other information

Communications or utilization information
Through your use of telecommunications services to access the NetApp Platform, your communications data (e.g. Internet protocol (“IP”) address) or utilization data (e.g. information on the beginning, end and extent of each access, and information on the telecommunications services you accessed) are technically generated. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the NetApp Platform, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the NetApp Platform. We may also derive your approximate location and your company from your IP address.
Information collected automatically through your browser or device
When you access the NetApp Platform, we may automatically collect information such as: type of Internet browser and operating system used, domain name of the Web site from which you came, number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed. We use this information to ensure the NetApp Platform function properly, monitor the relevancy of the NetApp Platform and improve their performance or content.
“Cookies” - information stored automatically on your computer
A cookie is a piece of Electronic Network Information that is stored on your computer’s hard drive by your Web browser. When you revisit  www.netapp.com , our server recognizes the cookie, giving us information about your prior visits. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you can still use most of the features of the NetApp Platform, including ordering items. We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals. We work with companies, such as Adobe, that use third-party cookies and Web beacons to collect anonymous information that helps us measure and improve our content and advertising effectiveness. Adobe collects and analyzes anonymous usage and volume statistical information from our users. We also use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the NetApp Platform and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by viewing their  Privacy & Terms , and exercise the opt out offered by  NetApp Cookie Policy .
Clear gifs (web beacons, web bugs)
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web beacons or Web bugs) along with other technologies such as e-tags, and JavaScript that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies that are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs, which are about the size of a period, are embedded invisibly on Web pages. For detailed information regarding NetApp’s use of Clear Gifs and other technologies, please refer to the  NetApp Cookie Policy .
Adobe flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies
We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store Electronic Network Information about your use of the NetApp Platform. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also go to the Global Storage Settings Panel and follow the instructions (which may explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information”), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.
Uses and disclosures of other information
We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information. If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.
Retention period
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the NetApp Platform to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the NetApp Platform);
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
