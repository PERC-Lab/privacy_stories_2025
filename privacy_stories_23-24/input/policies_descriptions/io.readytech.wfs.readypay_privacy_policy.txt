Collection under the Privacy Act (New Zealand) does not include our receipt of unsolicited information from a person. This means that if a person provides us with their personal information and we have not asked them for such information, our receipt of that information will not be considered our collection of it and will not be afforded the protections under New Zealand Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) 1 to 4. Nevertheless, any unsolicited information that we receive from a person will be afforded the same security that other personal information is given as set out above in this Privacy Policy.    Provision of personal information to third parties  Where it is necessary for personal information to be given to a third party in connection with the provision of a service they provide to us, we will do everything reasonably within our power to prevent unauthorised use or unauthorised disclosure of the information by them.   The specific personal information that we collect, how we collect it, how we use it and who we disclose it to, is set out above in this Privacy Policy.   Requests for access to and correction of personal information   Individuals whose personal information is governed by the Privacy Act (New Zealand) are entitled to seek access to and correction of it in accordance with that legislation.   As set out above, any person who wishes to access personal information about them held in any of our platforms should contact the relevant customer in the first instance.   In the event that a person wishes to access their personal information and it is readily retrievable by us, they can also request from us either of the following:
to obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not we hold such personal information; and
access to the personal information and be advised if they are able to correct such personal information.
We will as soon as possible and in any event no later than 20 working days from the date on which the request is made, decide to grant or refuse the request and provide the person who made the request with or post to them, our decision.  We may in our discretion charge a reasonable fee for making information available in compliance with the request or for correcting any information in compliance with a request (in whole or in part) or for attaching a statement of any correction sought but not made, subject to our compliance with the IPPs.   If a person submits a request to access their personal information to us, we may refuse their request on one or more of the grounds set out in the Privacy Act (New Zealand).   If we refuse to comply with a request to access their personal information, we will provide the individual who made the request with our reasons for our denial and an opportunity to file a complaint with the Commissioner, to seek an investigation and a review of the refusal.    Where we hold personal information governed by the Privacy Act (New Zealand) about an individual, they are entitled to:
request correction of the information; and
request that there be attached to the information a statement of the correction sought but not made.
[Dropdown 2: European Customers and Data subjects]    This section of our Privacy Policy applies to personal data of customers and data subjects that may be collected by us that is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR). Article 4(1) of the GDPR defines ‘personal data’ as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Although we are not strictly ‘controllers’ of data subjects’ personal data (other than with respect to data subjects who are customer personnel), in that we do not determine how and why such data will be used, as that is determined by the customer; we are committed to complying with our requirements under the GDPR in our capacity as a processer.   Collection of personal data  Customers are responsible for the collection of personal data of data subjects and for obtaining the relevant consents and authorisations necessary for us to process data subject personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Paragraph
5.3
above explains how we collect data subject personal data and the sources that provide us with data subject personal data. We do not collect data subject personal data from any publicly available sources. Paragraph
5
above sets out how we collect personal data of customer personnel.    We collect all categories of personal data that an end user enters into our platforms or that is held in a ReadyTech Group platform with respect to a data subject. For more information about the categories of personal data that we collect about data subjects and customers, please see paragraph
4
above.   Purpose for processing customer and data subject personal data and our legal basis for doing so  The table in paragraph
6.1
above sets out the legal basis under which we process customer and data subject personal data pursuant to Article 6(1) of the GDPR.    Who will receive customer and data subject personal data  Detailed information about who we disclose personal information to is set out in paragraph
9
above. This applies equally to personal data governed by the GDPR.   International transfers  We only transfer customer and data subject personal data governed by the GDPR internationally as set out in paragraph
9
above in compliance with the GDPR. We have legally binding agreements in place that govern the receipt and processing of personal data transferred offshore. Information about other appropriate or suitable safeguards is available from us for customer personnel and data subjects whose personal data is governed by the GDPR, on request.   Retention of customer and data subject personal data  It is our policy to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of any person only as long as is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data was collected for the minimum length of time permitted by applicable law and only thereafter for the purposes of deleting or returning that personal data (except where we also need to retain the data in order to comply with our legal obligations, or to retain the data to protect any other person's vital interests).   Requirement to provide customer and data subject personal data to us  Please see paragraph
11
above for information about the requirement to provide personal information to us and the limitations that apply where personal information is not provided.  Those requirements and limitations apply equivalently to personal data governed by the GDPR.   Automated decision making  Some of our platforms include functionality that uses automated decision making. This functionality is designed to determine when data should be flagged for further processing by one of our platforms or disclosed to third parties. The specific circumstances under which this will occur will be set out in a contract that we enter into with a customer. Data subjects can obtain more information about this from their customer. We do not use automated decision making in our capacity as a controller.   Further processing activities by us  We will not carry out any further processing activities on customer or data subject personal data, other than as set out in this Privacy Policy.    Rights under the GDPR   Under the GDPR, individuals have a number of rights, including:
The right to be informed
The right of access
The right to rectification
The right to erasure
The right to restrict processing
The right to data portability
The right to object to processing
Customers and data subjects also have the right to lodge a complaint with any relevant supervisory authority. Data subjects are encouraged to contact their customer in the first instance, if they wish to exercise any of their applicable rights under the GDPR.      [Dropdown 3: ReadyTech Personnel]  This section of our Privacy Policy applies to personal information that the ReadyTech Group collects, processes and manages about any person employed or engaged by the ReadyTech Group.    Personnel with any questions about our privacy practices, can contact their manager or our Privacy Representative / Data Protection Officer set out above.     Why we collect personal information about our personnel  All personnel have contracts in place which govern their relationship with us. We collect personal information of our personnel for the following purposes:
enforcing our contractual rights and company policies;
complying with our legal obligations; and
otherwise managing our businesses.

We also collect employee medical information, emergency contact details, dates of birth and next of kin details.    Subject to applicable laws, we may carry out electronic surveillance of our personnel when they use our computer equipment, smartphone devices and networks (such as IP addresses, usage patterns, access logs and usernames, computer names, traffic firewalls and websites visited).    Employee biometric fingerprint data is also collected for the purposes of recording employee start and end times who are employed by some ReadyTech Group companies.   We also collect personal information about our personnel in the following ways:

For example, during an emergency we may contact an employee’s nominated next of kin using their contact details or when discussing personal matters that are affecting a person’s performance at work with their managers;
when recruiting employees or engaging, we may contact a law enforcement agency for the purpose of obtaining a criminal history check;
