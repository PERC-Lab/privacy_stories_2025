In some cases, we may receive cookie information, contact information, and education information about you from other sources. These sources include schools, partners, customers, social networks, advertising networks, marketing partners, and publicly available databases. Subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, we use this information to advertise to you, to provide our products and Services to you, and to obtain information about how you are using our Sites and Services. If you sign in with your Google account to provide us with content, Google will share your contact information and the photographs you choose to provide us with.
3. How We Use Your Personal Data
In addition to the purposes stated above, we may use all the personal data we collect in accordance with applicable law such as to:
Maintain and improve our Sites and Services;
Protect the security and integrity of our Sites and Services;
Investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our
Terms of Use , and to otherwise fulfill our legal obligations;
Monitor compliance with and enforce this Privacy Policy and any applicable agreements and policies;
Defend our legal rights and the rights of others;
Fulfill any other purposes for which you provide it;
For any purpose that is reasonably necessary to or compatible with the original purpose for which we collected the personal data as disclosed to you; and
Comply with applicable law.
4. How We Share Your Personal Data
We may share the personal data that we collect about you in the following ways:
With vendors who perform data or Site-related services on our behalf (e.g., advertising and marketing providers, customer relationship management platforms, social media platforms, payment processors, product delivery providers);
To the extent that we are required to do so by law;
In connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;
To establish, exercise, or defend our or a third party’s legal rights, including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention;
With any person who we reasonably believe may apply to a court or other competent authority for disclosure of that personal data where, in our reasonable opinion, such court or authority would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that personal data;
With any other person or entity as part of any business or asset sale, equity transaction, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, or in preparation for any of these events;
With any other person or entity where you consent to the disclosure; and
For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the personal data or for any other purpose we deem necessary, including to protect the health or safety of others.
For more information on how we sell personal data to third parties, see our “ Your State Privacy Rights ” section below.
5. Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms
Our Sites recognize the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal. If you are using a browser setting or plug-in that sends an opt-out preference signal to each website you visit, we will treat that as a valid request to opt out. To download and use a browser supporting the GPC browser signal, click here:
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs . If you choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use.
Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, our Sites do not currently interpret, respond to, or alter their practices when they receive “Do Not Track” signals.
6. International Data Transfers
We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States for the purposes described in this policy. The United States may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. Your personal data can be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to the laws of the United States.
For any transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or the United Kingdom that we make to other entities as described in this Privacy Policy, we use appropriate safeguards to ensure for the lawful processing and transfer of the personal data, including, when appropriate, the use of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission and/or United Kingdom’s international data transfer agreement. To obtain a copy of the safeguards, contact us at
privacy@jostens.com .
7. Security
We maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the personal data we collect and store from loss, misuse, destruction, or unauthorized access. However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
8. Third Party Links
The Sites may contain links that will let you leave the Sites and access another website. Linked websites are not under our control. We accept no responsibility or liability for these other websites.
9. Children’s Privacy
The Sites and Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal data from children under 13.
10. Your State Privacy Rights
Depending on the state in which you reside, you may have certain privacy rights regarding your personal data. If you are a California resident, please see our “ Notice to California Residents ” section below. For other state residents, your privacy rights may include (if applicable):
The right to confirm whether or not we are processing your personal data and to access such personal data;
The right to obtain a copy of your personal data that we collected from and/or about you in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the information to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means;
The right to delete personal data that we collected from and/or about you, subject to certain exceptions;
The right to correct inaccurate personal data that we maintain about you, subject to certain exceptions;
The right, if applicable, to opt out of the processing of your personal data for purposes of (1) targeted advertising; (2) the “sale” of your personal data (as that term is defined by applicable law); and (3) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you;
If we are required by applicable law to obtain your consent to process sensitive personal data, the right to withdraw your consent; and
The right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy rights.
Depending on how the applicable privacy law defines a “sale,” we may sell personal data to third parties. For instance, if you are a resident of Colorado or Connecticut, our use of cookies and tracking technologies constitutes a sale of personal data to third-party advertisers. We also use cookies and other tracking technologies to display advertisements about our products to you on nonaffiliated websites, applications, and online services. This is “targeted advertising” under applicable privacy laws. We do not use personal data for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning individuals.

here
or by calling us at 1-855-314-8390. If legally required, we will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the individual on whose behalf you are making such request. To do so, we will ask you to verify data points based on information we have in our records. If you are submitting a request on behalf of another individual, please use the same contact methods described above. If we refuse to take action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision through our interactive webform available

Your Privacy Choices cookie preferences here.

Your Rights
If you are a California resident, you have the following rights with respect to your Personal Information:
The right to know what Personal Information we have collected about you, including the categories of Personal Information, the categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing Personal Information (if applicable), the categories of third parties to whom we disclose Personal Information (if applicable), and the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;

How to Submit a Request to Know, Delete, and/or Correct
You may submit a request to know, delete, and/or correct through our interactive webform available
here
or by calling us toll free at 1-855-314-8390.
If you are submitting a request on behalf of a California resident, please submit the request through one of the designated methods discussed above. After submitting the request, and if the request is not subject to an exemption or exception, we will require additional information to verify your authority to act on behalf of the California resident.
Our Process for Verifying a Request to Know, Delete, and/or Correct
We will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the California resident on whose behalf you are making such request.
We will verify your identity either to a “reasonable degree of certainty” or a “reasonably high degree of certainty” depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the risk of harm to you by unauthorized disclosure, deletion, or correction as applicable. To do so, we will ask you to verify data points based on information we have in our records concerning you.
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information
If you are a California resident, you have the right to direct us to stop selling or sharing your Personal Information.
You may submit a request to opt out of sales or sharing by clicking
Your Privacy Choices . If you have enabled privacy controls on your browser (such as a plugin), we will also treat that as a valid request to opt out. Please see the “ Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms ” section above for more information.
Notice of Financial Incentive
From time to time, you may have the opportunity to provide Personal Information in exchange for discounts and price differences. For example, we provide discounts and price differences in exchange for you subscribing to our mailing list. Categories of Personal Information that we may collect when you subscribe to receive discounts and price differences include your email address.
How to Opt-In and Right to Withdraw
Signing up for discounts and price differences is optional. By providing your email address during the discount sign-up process, you affirmatively opt in to receiving the financial incentive and to joining our mailing list. You have the right to withdraw from the financial incentive at any time. If you opt out of receiving a financial incentive, we will not reduce the value of any financial incentives you previously received from us. If you wish to withdraw from receiving the financial incentive, you may submit such a request at any time by emailing us at
privacy@jostens.com .
How the Financial Incentive is Reasonably Related to the Value of Your Personal Information
The financial incentive or price difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your Personal Information. We take into consideration, without limitation, the anticipated revenue generated from such information, the anticipated expenses which we might incur in the collection, storage, and use of such information, and the anticipated expenses which we might incur related to the offer, provision, and imposition of any financial incentive or price difference. Based on this analysis, the value of your Personal Information that allows us to make these offers and financial incentives is the value of the offer itself.
Shine the Light Law
If you are a California resident, California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes (as those terms are defined in that statute). To make such a request, please send an email to
privacy@jostens.com
with the subject line “Shine the Light Request.”
Removal of Posted Information by Minors
Our customers who are California residents under 18 years of age (“California Minors”) and are registered users of a Jostens online service, application, or mobile application (“Property”) directed to minors can remove, or request and obtain removal of, content or information posted by the California Minor on such Property. Certain Properties offer functionality to remove posted content. If functionality to remove posted content is not available, California Minors can request removal by emailing
remove@jostens.com
with “California Minor Content Removal Request” in the subject line and in the body of the message. Please specify in the request the Property to which the request relates and the specific information or content you posted for which you are requesting removal. Please note that the removal of content and information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the posted content or information.
14. Europe and the United Kingdom
If you are in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in the United Kingdom, you are entitled to the following explanation of the legal bases we rely on to process your Personal Data and a description of your privacy rights.
Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Data
The legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
Consent
We may process your Personal Data based on your consent such as when you create an account or when you ask us to send certain kinds of marketing communications. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Our Legitimate Interests
We may process your Personal Data if doing so is necessary for our legitimate interests and your rights as an individual do not override those legitimate interests.

To Perform a Contract
We may process your Personal Data to administer and fulfill contractual obligations to you.

Restrict Our Use of Your Personal Data
You have the right to ask us to place a restriction on our use of your Personal Data if one of the following applies to you:
You contest the accuracy of the information that we hold about you, while we verify its accuracy;
We have used your information unlawfully, but you request us to restrict its use instead of erasing it;
We no longer need the information for the purpose for which we collected it, but you need it to deal with a legal claim; or
You have objected to us using your information, while we check whether our legitimate grounds override your right to object.
Object to Our Use of Your Personal Data
You have the right to object to our use of your Personal Data where our reason for using it is based on our legitimate interests or your consent (rather than when the reason for using it is to perform an obligation due to you under a contract with us).
Delete Your Personal Data
You can ask us to delete your Personal Data if:
We no longer need it for the purposes for which we collected it;
We have been using it with no valid legal basis;
We are obligated to erase it to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
We need your consent to use the information and you withdraw consent;
You object to us processing your Personal Data where our legal basis for doing so is our legitimate interests and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing.
However, this right is not absolute. Even if you make a request for deletion, we may need to retain certain information for legal or administrative purposes, such as record keeping, maintenance of opt-out requirements, defending or making legal claims, or detecting fraudulent activities. We will retain information in accordance with the “ How Long Is Your Personal Data Kept ” section below.
If you do exercise a valid right to have your Personal Data deleted, please keep in mind that deletion by third parties to whom the information has been provided might not be immediate and that the deleted information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period (but will not be available to others).
Transfer Your Personal Data to Another Service Provider
You may request that we transfer some of the Personal Data you have provided to you or another service provider in electronic copy. This applies to Personal Data we are processing to service a contract with you and to Personal Data we are processing based on your consent.
To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described in the “ How to Contact Us ” section above.
Make a Complaint
If you have any concerns or complaints regarding our processing of your Personal Data, please contact us as described in the “ How to Contact Us ” section above and we will do our best to answer any question and resolve any complaint to your satisfaction.
If, for whatever reason, you feel we do not meet the standards you expect of us, you are also entitled to make a complaint to your local supervisory authority:
EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs)
Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC)
Information Commissioner’s Office (United Kingdom)
How Long Is Your Personal Data Kept?
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect it and as set out in this Privacy Policy and for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements that apply to us.
