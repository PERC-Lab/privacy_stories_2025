​
We care about privacy at Noteful. This policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal data, and how you can control that usage.
​
This Statement of Privacy governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to Noteful LLC include  noteful.net  and Noteful, an education application. By using the Noteful app or  noteful.net , you consent to the data practices described in this statement.
​
The Data We Collect
If you register for an account on our website or application, you provide us with your first and last name, your e-mail address (or the email address of a parent), and your age. We use this to customize the application to you, and to contact you about our services.
​
The Noteful application stores an identifier unique to your account in local storage in your browser or on your mobile device. This identifier allows us to automatically log you in the next time you use Noteful. Third parties may also keep track of an identifier for the purpose of delivering personalized advertisements, see  Sharing Information with Third Parties
If you purchase Noteful's products and services, we collect billing and credit card information. This information is used to complete the purchase transaction.
​
We collect data on your progress through the Noteful education application, including the lessons you have taken, the questions you have answered and how you answered them. We also collect any feedback you provide through the app. We use this data to give you feedback on how you are learning, to customize your educational experience, and to improve the educational services we deliver.
​
The Noteful application may ask you to sing. We record your voice for the purpose of giving you feedback on your ear training skills. The recording never leaves your phone or browser, and is deleted immediately after we have analyzed it for the notes you sing.
​
Sharing Information with Third Parties
Noteful does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. We do use advertising networks such as Google to deliver you ads within the Noteful application. These advertising networks may associate an identifier with you in order to personalize the ads that are served to you. If you wish to opt-out of ad personalization, you can do that from within the settings of the app (use the gear icon) or by using the settings of your mobile device or browser, if it provides them. Note that opting out of personalization does not mean that you will not be served ads.
​
We may share your username, first name, profile picture, and information about your learning progress (XP, streak, keys, and stars) with other Noteful application users, for the purpose of encouraging our users to connect to their friends, tracking their friends' progress, and promoting learning within the application. You can also send congratulations to other users on their achievements.
​
Right to Deletion
Subject to certain exceptions set out below, on receipt of a verifiable request from you, we will delete your personal information from our records. Please note that we may not be able to comply with requests to delete your personal information if it is necessary to:
Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected or provide a service requested by you;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity;
Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; or
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
​
Children under the age of digital consent
At Noteful, we realize that we need to take special care to protect children under the age of digital consent. Our child users are treated differently in order to ensure that we collect the minimum information necessary to provide our educational services, and to make sure parents are in control.
​
We collect age to determine which users are children under the age of 13. For children, we collect only a username so they can log in, a parent's email address so we can notify the parent about our privacy and information policies for child users, and information about the child's progress in the application.
​
Child users are treated specially in the following ways:
​
We do not collect first or last names.
We do not collect profile pictures.
We turn off ad personalization so that children are not tracked by third-party advertisers.
For children under the age of 16, advertisements are set to family safe content.
The social aspects of the app are turned off for children, so no-one sees their usernames and no other user can communicate with them in any way.
​
Once children reach the age of 13 (or 16 for family safe advertisements), we turn on the above features of the application.
​
We provide information about our personal data practices for children on our home page and wherever we knowingly collect personal data from children on our application. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this application. If you are a parent and you have questions regarding our data collection practices, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this Statement of Privacy. For the purposes of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule ("COPPA"), Noteful collects personal information from children under 13 for the sole purpose of performing internal operations of the Service. If we discover that we have unintentionally collected additional personal information from children, we will delete it. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us at the address below.
