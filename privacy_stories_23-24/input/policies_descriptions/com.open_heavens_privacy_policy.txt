The Open Heavens International Centre, publishers of the Open Heavens Daily Devotional authored by Pastor E.A Adeboye, will NEVER request for donations to prisoners, less privileged persons, Internally Displaced Camps, sick persons or for special prayers and prophecies etc from the public.
We do not endorse or assume responsibility for any money donated to bogus bodies and will not be a party to or in any way be responsible for any claims of being duped or mismanagement of funds. Over the years, Open Heavens International Centre has embarked on several corporate social responsibility projects without requesting for financial support or donations from the general public.
We encourage members of the public not to donate any monies and to always investigate thoroughly any similar claims in future.
