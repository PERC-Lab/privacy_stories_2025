Online Privacy Policy
View our Privacy Notice
We respect and value your privacy. Our Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes and applies to the information we collect from you when you visit this website ("Website"). The terms "we," "our," and "us" in this Privacy Policy refer to Faith Community United Credit Union. Our Privacy Policy generally describes how we collect, share, use, and protect your information. If you are a customer who has opened an account or obtained a financial product or service from us for personal, family, or household purposes, our Privacy Notice may apply to you as well and further explains how we may use your information.
1. Information We Collect
When you visit our Website, we receive and collect certain information about you. The information that we receive and collect depends in part on what you do when you visit our Website. You may be able to improve your experience on our Website when you tell us who you are – for example, by signing up for e-mail or newsletters, applying for products, making inquiries, or requesting further information about a product or service. Some of the information you may submit is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person. Examples include your name, phone number, address, and social security number. It is possible to browse our Website without actively submitting any personally identifiable information. We may use this information for a number of purposes, for example, to better service your requests and/or inquiries, monitor Website usage and/or performance, improve the customer experience of our Website, ensure technological compatibility with your computer, protect against fraud or identity theft, or conduct aggregate analyses on usage patterns.
Automatically Collected Information
Every time you visit a website, some information is automatically collected from you. For example, this information may include some or all of the following items: your computer's Internet protocol (IP) address and/or domain; type and version of Internet browser software and operating system you use; date, time, and duration of your Website access; specific pages, buttons, images, videos, links, or forms that you access while visiting the Website; and demographic information concerning the country of origin of your computer and the language(s) used by it.
Information Collected via Cookies and Other Similar Technology
“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your computer to distinguish you from other visitors to our Website. The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect or track information about your activities while using the website. We or our third party advertising service providers may place cookies or similar files on your hard drive for many of the reasons listed above while visiting our Website. Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit websites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can choose not to accept cookies. You can also delete cookies from your computer at any time. If you refuse cookies, the functionality of our Website may be impacted or become nonfunctional. In addition to using cookies, we or our third party advertising service providers may also use similar technologies to track users’ interactions with our Website. Some of these technologies include web beacons (transparent graphical images placed on a website) and flash objects. We may use these technologies on our Website to verify your identity, remember personal settings including your preferences, to offer you additional options or enhance your online experience, and to improve our products and services. We may also use them for marketing site personalization, and tracking of online applications and programs and/or track the effectiveness of advertisements for our products and services, referred to as banner ads, that we may place on our Website or other linked and/or partner websites.
Cookies used for tracking advertising effectiveness do not collect personally identifiable information.

3. E-Mail Communications
Forms of communication such as, e-mail, text messaging, our Website Contact Us or similar forms, or other forms of electronic communication are inherently insecure. Please refrain from submitting sensitive personal information (such as account number or social security number) via email or similar method of communication.

We may retain the content of the e-mail, your e-mail address, and our response in order to better service your needs or for legal and regulatory reasons.

We are not responsible for any losses or damages in connection with the information, security, privacy practices, availability, content or accuracy of materials of such third party websites.

We encourage you to review the privacy and security policies of all third party websites before you share any personally identifiable information.
6. Additional Uses or Sharing of Your Information
Unless you are a member and have opted-out of receiving marketing offers based on your eligibility information, see our Member Privacy Policy, we may use information about your relationship with us, such as what types of accounts you have, as well as transactional information, and the state/region in which you do your transactions in to tailor advertisements to you while you are on our Website. These advertisements may take the form of banner ads to offer you additional products and services, or enhance your online experience.
In addition to those methods discussed in this Privacy Policy, we may use and share your information, including personally identifiable information, without limitation, in the following manner:
In response to judicial or other governmental subpoenas, warrants and court orders served on us in accordance with their terms, or as otherwise required by applicable law;
To comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of governmental authorities;
To protect our rights or property, protect our legitimate business interests, to enforce the provisions of our terms or policies, in cases of customer fraud/disputes, and/or to prevent harm to you or others;

As disclosed in other applicable policies, terms of use, or other agreements; or
As permitted or required by law or as authorized by you.
7. Online Security
Our Credit Union is constantly concerned about our member’s critical information and privacy. With this in mind, we have the following security services installed on our Internet server:
Each server is behind a Firewall. This UNIX based hardware product blocks critical ports and IP addresses on servers from external attack and access.
Each server runs proprietary software that constantly monitors the servers for unauthorized use and attempts to "hack" into information. Administrators are contact when forced attacks are committed, and countermeasures can be applied to stop these instances.
All administrative activity requires user login and authentication. All administrative updates are logged into files that can be reviewed later.
All servers come with a Global Verisign Certificate (RSA) for digitally encrypted communications between the Web server and your member. Information passed in applications cannot be decrypted by third parties attempting to "pick" information being passed across the Internet backbone.
All servers run the latest version of Apache Web Server, considered the strongest and most secure Web server software on the market.
8. How to Protect Your Personally Identifiable Information
You have a role in helping us by safeguarding your information from others. You have several options when deciding how you can best protect your personally identifiable information. One option is simply not to volunteer it. The Federal Trade Commission's websites (www.ftc.gov, www.ftc.gov/idtheft, and www.onguardonline.gov) offer useful information about how to protect your personally identifiable information.
9. Suspicious E-Mail
We will never e-mail you to request personal account information over the Internet or by any other means. Help protect yourself against online fraud - if you suspect that an unsolicited e-mail is fraudulent, please contact us.
10. Notice to Persons Accessing this Website Outside the United States
If you reside outside the U.S., any information you provide to us on our Website will be transferred out of your country and into the U.S. If you do not want your personally identifiable information to leave your country, do not provide the information to us. By providing personally identifiable information to us, you explicitly consent to the transfer of your information to the U.S.
11. Changes to our Online Privacy Policy
Please note that we will periodically make changes to our Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. Your continued use of our Website constitutes your acceptance of any amendments to and the most recent versions of this Privacy Policy.
