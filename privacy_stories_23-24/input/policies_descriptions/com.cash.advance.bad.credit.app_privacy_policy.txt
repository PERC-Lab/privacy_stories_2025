Privacy Policy App
You can rely on us regarding your safety
We recognize the significance of protecting personal data. This Privacy Policy was created to inform you about the
procedures and guidelines we follow while managing your data on this App “Cash Advance for Bad Credit”. Before using
the App, please take a moment to read this section.
Please be aware that using our App means your agreement to our Privacy Policy.
1. The Types of Information We Gather
You voluntarily provide us with the following information, both individually identifiable and anonymous.
Information that recognizes you specifically and enables us to contact you is known as personally identifiable
information. When you join up and start sending requests, you provide us with it. Your full name, phone number,
address, date of birth, income, driver's license, credit history, social security number, essential employment
information, bank account, and military status are only some examples of the data types that might be included.
Non-personally identifiable data is information that cannot be used to identify you specifically. Anonymized data may
include, but is not limited to, your IP address, language, the length of your browsing session, your clicks, etc.
Such information is gathered through pixel tags, web beacons, and cookies.
Cookies are kept on your phone, but they were initially sent by an app you visited. Small transparent visual images
that enable tracking of users' behavior are referred to as web beacons and pixel tags.
2. The Reasons for Information Collection
Users’ personal information must be collected to successfully run the business, enhance technical assistance, and
conduct marketing research. We also require your private information to complete your application and link you with
the lender.
3. How We Disseminate Your Private Data
Your permission to process your application and get in touch with a lender is granted by your provision of personally
identifiable information. Since a lender cannot accept your loan without knowing something about you, it follows that
we have the right to disclose this information to a third party.
Keep in mind that lenders may ask national databases and credit reporting companies to verify your personal
information. Your credit score may be impacted by these queries. Moreover, for business administration, marketing,
advertising, consumer behavior research, security, and customer service enhancement, we may share some of your
personal information with our partners, affiliates, and other authorized third parties.
We keep the right to disclose your information to another organization that has bought our company or merged with us.
If such a circumstance arises, we'll let you know about these changes by email or a notice put on our app. If it is
essential to comply with a legal process, to carry out a legal proceeding, or to defend our rights, we may release
your personally identifiable information if forced to do so by law.
4. The Way We Distribute Your Non-Personally Identifiable Information
By gathering and disclosing your non-personally identifiable information to third parties, we may enhance our
technical support, monitor customer behavior, and collect online statistics essential for the management of our
company. For these reasons, we may provide information to further third parties.
5. Links from Unaffiliated Parties
Links to other third-party sites may be found when exploring our app. You are merely provided with them for reference
purposes, so you click them voluntarily. As we do not administer those sites, we are not liable for their terms,
policies, or practices, including their content, privacy policies, or terms of service.
6. Marketing Techniques
You confirm that you are informed about our marketing policies by using our App. You are not against receiving
adverts, marketing messages, newsletters, and other promotional items from us.
Using all the contacts you've given us, our third-party partners can also contact you with their marketing
communications. Therefore, when you use our App for the first time, you consent to receive these types of messages
from us and our third-party partners.
Please email us if you do not wish to get any marketing messages. However, if you want to unsubscribe from messages
from our third parties, you need to get in touch with them directly.
Please keep in mind that we have no control over third parties' marketing strategies and are not liable for them.
7. Information Protection Procedures
We use safeguards and advanced safety procedures that comply with the standards of US legislation in this area to
keep your personal information private. This means that your data is only accessible to authorized people. They are
only permitted to do so for legal commercial reasons under US law.
We undertake all efforts to keep your data safe, but we cannot guarantee that. This is not possible because we cannot
monitor lawbreakers.
8. Notice for Foreigners
We offer our services only to the residents of the US. Please do not use our App if you are a foreigner.
9. Warning to Minors
We can only provide our services to adults over the age of 18. Avoid downloading and installing our App if you are
under 18. As stated above, we do not intentionally collect information from children. 10. Amendments to the Privacy
Policy
We keep the right to adjust, change, and update this page. We may modify or update it without prior notice.
Therefore, we ask you to read this section occasionally. You will be assumed to have consented to the changes if you
keep using our App after we have amended the Privacy Policy.
