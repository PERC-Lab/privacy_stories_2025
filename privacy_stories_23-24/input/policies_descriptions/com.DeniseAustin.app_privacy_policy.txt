OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OUR WEBSITE Tracking Of User Experience A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Website. We link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Website. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Website. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in connection with your Internet browser. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Website, but your ability to use some areas of our Website may be limited. We use Google Analytics Advertising products: Re-marketing with Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics collects data about our site traffic via Google Advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. Data collected via these Google products is not linked with any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Website. If you wish to opt out of the Google Analytics data collection, you may do so on Google’s website at  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ . We, and our third party tracking utilities-partners, employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users on our Website. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on webpages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we and, in some instances, our third party tracking-utility partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. These third party tracking-utility partners may collect information about your activity on our site and your interaction with our advertising and other communications and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications. The Website is not presently configured to respond to DNT or “do not track” signals from web browsers. We use information which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Advertisements We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner may use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on the Website and other websites that you may visit to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. We are not responsible for, and cannot control, the actions of third parties, and cannot be held responsible for the conduct of such third parties. Social Media Features The Website includes social media features, such as a “Like” button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them. Forums Our Website offers blogs or community forums that may be publicly accessible (or accessible by other users of the Website). You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at  support@deniseaustin.com  in some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. MARKETING MATERIAL We and our affiliates (including Healthy Lifestyle Brands, LLC) may use your personal information to provide you with material, promotions and communications from time to time about services and products available to you from us, our affiliates, or from other service providers in partnership with us, or to invite you to continue to use our services. We will not sell your personal information to other providers without your consent. You may opt out of receiving promotional materials from us at any time by contacting us at  support@deniseaustin.com  or by following the ‘unsubscribe’ link on the relevant promotional emails. PROTECTING AND MAINTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION We will take all reasonable steps to protect the information we hold about you from unauthorized access, use and disclosure, however we cannot guarantee that our systems and stored data will be completely free from third party intrusion or interception or are free from corruption. Certain parts of the Website (such as those parts that require you to provide us with your credit card number) provide the ability for you to transmit information to our Website in an encrypted form by using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, other parts of the Website are not protected by any form of encryption to protect information you send from your computer to us over the Internet. Further, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. In light of this, we cannot ensure or warrant, and do not warrant, the security or privacy of your personal information, including payment and account details. You transmit this information at your own risk. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your passwords and/or any account information. We will destroy or de-identify your personal information when it is no longer needed by us, or required to be kept by law. Please note that, as you may continue to have access to your account after your service subscription expires, we will continue to retain your personal information on the Website so that you may access it. We may also keep backup copies of your personal information, even if you delete your account from the Website. We will also preserve the content of any email or information you submit to us through the Website if we believe we have a legal requirement to do so, or if any form of email abuse is suspected. If you use our Website to link to another site we encourage you to view their terms and conditions of use, privacy policies and security statements before disclosing any of your personal information on those sites. We are not responsible for, and you hereby release us from any liability or claims arising from your use of any such third party site. ACCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION It is your responsibility to advise us of any changes to your personal details to ensure we can continue to effectively provide services to you. If you wish to access the information we hold about you, please submit a request to us at  support@deniseaustin.com  or log into your account to make appropriate changes. If you believe that the personal information we hold about you is incorrect, you are entitled to request amendment of such information. You may also request that we delete the personal information that we hold about you. Please note that if we delete your contact information, we may not be able to provide you with the subscribed service. If you request us not to use personal information in a particular manner or at all, we will adopt reasonable measures to observe your request but we may, to the extent permitted by law, still use or disclose your information if you subsequently consent to the disclosure or we believe the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist a law enforcement agency or as otherwise required or authorized by law. For Residents of the State of California in the United States Only. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. In general, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which the business disclosed and shared information in the preceding calendar year.
