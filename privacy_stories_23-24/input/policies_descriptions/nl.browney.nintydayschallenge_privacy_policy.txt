Last Updated: September 18, 2023
Introduction
Welcome to the 90 Day Challenge app. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about how we look after your personal data while using our mobile application (regardless of whether you use it on Android or iOS) or engaging with our services, and it tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.
This privacy policy pertains to the 90 Day Challenge app, a product of 90 DC B.V. Any reference to "90 DC B.V." in the following articles refers to the 90 Day Challenge app.
This policy applies to all users of the 90 Day Challenge app and its associated services. It is intended to comply with the laws and regulations in the place where the user lives. Our goal is to create a relationship with our users based on trust, and we are dedicated to ensuring that we earn that trust by following all legal requirements related to privacy.
Information We Collect
In order to provide our services, we collect several types of information from our users. Our primary method of collecting information involves your active provision of details during the sign-up process and subsequent updates to your account. This includes personal identifiers such as your name, email address, date of birth, and fitness-related information. Additionally, should you opt to sign in using external services like Apple, Google, or Facebook, we access and store the email address associated with these accounts, facilitating a seamless sign-in process while verifying your identity. The types of information we collect are as follows:
Personal Identification Information: This includes your first name, last name, and date of birth. We use this information to personalize your experience and communicate with you effectively.
Contact Information: We collect your email address for account setup, notifications, and for sending information related to our services. If you provide an additional email address, we may use that for secondary communication or as a recovery email.
Account Information: Your password is collected and stored securely to protect your account. We use strong encryption methods to ensure the safety of your account.
Fitness Information: We gather information related to your fitness goals, such as your workout goal, weight goal, fitness level, the number of days per week you wish to train, your height, weight, and preferred measurement system. This helps us tailor your fitness program according to your individual needs and preferences.
You can choose not to provide certain information, but this might limit your ability to take full advantage of our services. We take your privacy seriously and strive to collect only the necessary information needed to provide you with our services.
Please note that all information shared remains private and is not made public in any way unless you give us explicit permission to share your progress.
We also collect communications exchanged between you and 90 DC. B.V., such as Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, updates to features, technical and security notices). Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving Service-related emails.
The Purposes of Processing
We primarily gather your information to enhance our service delivery and craft a personalized fitness experience for you. We use your personal identifiers to tailor your user experience and validate your age, ensuring you meet the age requirements for our services. Your contact information facilitates account setup, management, and correspondence about service-related updates or addressing any concerns. The fitness information you provide guides us in creating personalized fitness plans according to your specific goals, fitness level, and preferences.
Application of Collected information
We leverage your provided information in several ways to enhance your experience and our service delivery. Personal identifiers help us to personalize your interactions with our service. We use your contact information for account setup, management, addressing your queries, and service-related communication. Fitness information is utilized to curate personalized fitness plans that align with your goals and preferences, enabling us to deliver a comprehensive and customized fitness service.
Place
The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own.
Retention Time
We hold your personal data as long as it is essential for service provision, legal obligations, dispute resolution, or policy enforcement. Personal identifiers and contact information are retained throughout your relationship with us. Account information, specifically your password, is held as long as you maintain an account with us. Your fitness information is preserved for the duration of your active account for progress tracking and fitness program adjustments. Note that anonymized or aggregated data may be held indefinitely, as it can no longer personally identify you.
Security measures
At the 90DC B.V. we take your data security seriously and implement a range of measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
We use HTTPS for all communications between your devices and our services. This protocol ensures that all data transferred remains encrypted in transit, reducing the risk of interception by unauthorized parties. We also store your password using strong encryption methods. In fact, the encryption is so secure that even we can't access your password. If you forget your password, it can't be retrieved—it must be reset. We implement protections against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This means that we verify the source of each request to ensure it's made from a legitimate user session, providing an additional layer of security. Our system has robust controls in place to determine who can send requests to our backend endpoints. These constraints add another layer of security and further protect your information from unauthorized access.
Despite these extensive security measures, we must remind you that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
We strongly encourage you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer and to use unique passwords for your 90 Day Challenge account.
How to exercise rights
If you wish to exercise any of your rights as described in this privacy policy, please contact us via the following methods:

Please note that we may request certain information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This security measure ensures that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Once we receive your request, we will review it, determine whether we can comply under applicable law, and respond within a reasonable timeframe.

Further Information about Retention Time
Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent. Therefore:

Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfill a legal obligation or upon order of an authority. Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
